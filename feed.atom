 I have an HP Envy 14 with i5 113G7 & Nvidia 1650 Ti Max-Q graphics. I recently installed Fedora and wanted to fully disable the Nvidia GPU, so that it would give me extra battery life.

 # Append the ~/bin directory to any user's path so that local files and applications can run correctly # Tell bash what to do if the ~$USER/.local/bin directory exists and where to find it if [[ $UID -ge 1000 && -d $HOME/.local/bin && -z $(echo $PATH | grep -o $HOME/.local/bin) ]] then export PATH="${PATH}:$HOME/.local/bin" fi 
 The problem is that when I log into the console (NOT a terminal) I get the error:

 I'm not well-versed in scripting but it seems to me that the 'if' command and 'then' statement are standard bash commands used in many scripts. I use the Fish shell and that runs just fine but I'm puzzled about this silly error. Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title says, I'm attempting to move over to Wayland finally. Most things are working well on my laptop (Intel 4th gen with iGPU graphics) so far, except for Steam and Discord. My compositor is dwl, hopefully that isn't the issue.
  
Steam
 I know Steam isn't Wayland-native, and needs to run through Xwayland. When I try to start the application, it gives this error message: ``` Check your DISPLAY environment variable and make sure that you have enabled X. If you are running remotely, make sure that you have a remote connection which will allow an X connection.
 For more information visit https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4050-WOJB-0608 ```
 I've also tried to run it in the command line, setting DISPLAY=:0, but that doesn't make a difference. Xwayland is installed, of course.
  
Discord
 As far as I've been able to figure out, Discord should run using these flags: discord --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland
 However, it simply crashes with this error message: ``` Discord 0.0.17 interface 'wl_output' has no event 4 tcmalloc: large alloc 1073741824 bytes == 0x21611af76000 @ 0x5635a7118d65 0x7f658edbb20f
 Failed to get crash dump id. Report Id: 1c94989d-fb11-45
 Failed to get crash dump id. Report Id: 9d605c7d-0ff2-40 zsh: illegal hardware instruction (core dumped) discord --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland
 ```
 As far as Xwayland goes, I can't seem to get anything to run with it. Not even xclock.
 I figure I must be doing something wrong, but I'm not sure what. I haven't been able to find anything helpful in the Wiki either, unfortunately.

 Windows games on my system no longer work. All my games on protondb are gold and platinum but only Gary’s Mod actually runs. Whenever I click to play a game, it just just says “launching” then “running” like it normally did but now it just crashes before even starting. Also every Linux game still runs normally.
 PC: 
 •Host: Razor Blade 15
 •Nvidia GPU
 •Intel GPU (Unused)
 •Intel CPU
 •FS System: ext4
 Things I’ve tried:
 •Rebooting 
 •Uninstalling and Reinstalling Steam (Runtime)
 •Uninstalling and Reinstalling all my Steam Games
 •Reading through the Arch Manuels (nothing worked)
 •Updating and retrying
 •Running every proton version
 •Running steam games through terminal (steam.sh all normal but didn’t show anything related to the game)

You can get an LG Curved UltraWide Monitor for more than $100 off and enjoy a three-sided virtually borderless display with adjustable tilt and height.
    
The 34″ monitor has a 21:9 screen ratio to provide accurate color, contrast, clarity, and detail, even when displaying wide angles. While it’s an obvious choice for gaming, it would also be great for streaming blockbuster movies and your favorite TV shows, editing videos, and just overall creation.
    

    
You’ll get a panoramic view to see everything with a great perspective. With that 3440 x 1440 space on the QYD VA display, you’ll get 33% more space than your standard 1920 x 1080 display. If you’re handling both home life and work, all from one monitor, you’ll have plenty of space to do all that multitasking.
    
But nothing will beat the experience you’ll get when gaming on the... Read more]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I tried installing Arch Linux, on a USB with Qtile, since I wanted to try it out and tested it on my Laptop (ASUS TUF DASH F15 FX51PC). I noticed that the keyboard lighting works out of the box (I haven't even mapped those keys to anything in my qtile config), so will this behaviour be replicated, if I install Arch Linux on the actual hardware? Also, I have windows installed on my Laptop, is this happening because of that? I wanted to ask this, because I have seen many people talk about how backlit keyboards don't work very well out of the box on Arch Linux, and some software like OpenRGB needs to be installed for them to work properly. So could someone please clarify this for me?
 Thanks

Since then I have been carrying out a more robust set of around 100 benchmarks across the original Graviton instance, Graviton2, Graviton3, and then up again Intel Xeon and AMD EPYC competing instances.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a multi monitor setup that I'd like to configure.
 I can do that perfectly fine through a shell script and executing that from my .xinitrc:
 #!/bin/sh # Configures monitors. xrandr --output "DP-4" --mode 1920x1080 --rate 144.00 --right-of "HDMI-0" --primary xrandr --output "HDMI-0" --mode 1920x1080 --rate 74.97 --left-of "DP-4" 
 However, from what I can see from the Arch Wiki, this is not the proper way of configuring things.
 Thus, I'm trying to make the two files /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-monitor.conf and /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia.conf as instructed, but they just don't work and I'm left straching my head as to why. They are as follows:
 10-monitor.conf:
 Section "Monitor" Identifier "DP-4" Modeline "1920x1080_144.00" 452.50 1920 2088 2296 2672 1080 1083 1088 1177 -hsync +vsync Option "Primary" "true" Option "PreferredMode" "1920x1080_144.0" EndSection Section "Monitor" Identifier "HDMI-0" Modeline "1920x1080_75.00" 220.75 1920 2064 2264 2608 1080 1083 1088 1130 -hsync +vsync Option "LeftOf" "DP-4" Option "PreferredMode" "1920x1080_74.97" EndSection 
 20-nvidia.conf:
 Section "Device" Identifier "Device0" Driver "nvidia" VendorName "NVIDIA Corporation" Option "monitor-HDMI-1" "HDMI-1" Option "monitor-DisplayPort-4" "DP-4" EndSection 
 I also have tried renaming 20-nvidia.conf to 05-device.conf as instructed in this article of the Arch Wiki, that also didn't help.
 Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fine aprile 2022 il ricercatore Mor Davidovich ha individuato un metodo per acquisire privilegi SYSTEM su qualunque sistema Windows collegato a un dominio.Davidovich ha spiegato di aver 'assemblato' il codice proveniente da diversi tool preesistenti per sviluppare un'applicazione (KrbRelayUp), pubblicata su GitHub, che conente a un utente di acquistare privilegi che non gli competono.In un altro articolo abbiamo visto le differenze tra i privilegi SYSTEM e i diritti di amministratore in Windows.L'aspetto più rilevante della ricerca condotta da Davidovich è che l'acquisizione dei privilegi SYSTEM sui sistemi utilizzati in ambito aziendale funziona anche con la configurazione predefinita del dominio. L'esperto in un primo tempo ha fatto presente che l'attacco KrbRelayUp non andava in porto nel caso in cui l'amministratore di sistema avesse attivato la firma LDAP su Windows Server.Lunedì scorso Davidovich ha rilasciato una nuova versione del suo tool KrbRelayUp che porta all'ottenimento dei privilegi più elevati anche con firma LDAP abilitata.Pur confermando l'esistenza della problematica, Microsoft si è affrettata a precisare che l'attacco in questione non interessa i clienti che usano istanze di Azure Active Directory.KrbRelayUp può comunque aiutare eventuali aggressori a compromettere macchine virtuali Azure in ambienti Active Directory ibridi in cui i controller di dominio sono sincronizzati con Azure Active Directory.In una pagina di supporto appena pubblicata, Microsoft ha condiviso le metodologie per proteggersi dall'attacco KrbRelayUp.In generale, i tecnici dell'azienda di Redmond suggeriscono di attivare la firma LDAP, Extended Protection for Authentication (EPA) e impostare a 0 l'attributo MS-DS-Machine-Account-Quota.Una dimostrazione dell'attacco è stata pubblicata in questo post su Twitter..]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those who are familiar with the Unix system, you will also be familiar with the cron application that allows you to schedule and automate tasks to run on their own. We even have tutorials that show you how to get started with cron and crontabs. However, cron is not perfect, as it requires your system to be running 24 hours a day. If you have a habit of turning off your computer at night, and a cron job is scheduled in the sleeping hours, the task won’t be executed. Luckily, there are several cron alternatives that can do a better job than cron. Let’s check them out.

Phone and Macbook connects to speakers
 Phone plays an audio, speakers plays the audio.
 Phone stop playing audio, speaker is silent.
 Macbook plays an audio, speakers plays the audio.
 Macbook stop playing audio, speaker is silent.
 Phone plays an audio, speakers plays the audio.
  
Then if I do the same with my personal notebook with Arch and PipeWire with PulseAudio support if I do:
  
Phone and Macbook connects to speakers
 Phone plays an audio, speakers plays the audio.
 Phone stop playing audio, speaker is silent.
 Arch plays an audio, speakers plays the audio.
 Arch stop playing audio, speaker is silent.
 Phone plays an audio, speakers is silent.
 Arch plays an audio, speakers plays the audio.
  
Is like Arch/PipeWire keeps the speaker "busy" as if an audio is being played and not letting other devices stream to it.
 Anyone has any idea what can cause this?

Così non è stato ed è altamente probabile che anche l'azienda di Jen Hsun Huang si metta, essa stessa, sulla scia di AMD.L'utilizzo di interconnessioni performanti tra chiplet è e resterà una sfida cruciale per il futuro.]]></summary>

I had no customization with KDE simple plain KDE Desktop as it is with No Splash Screen and I think My graphical environment was taking half a minute to load up....
 Talking About GNOME which I was using before was stable working good no issues and I am damn Sure application load quite faster than KDE in GNOME but was slower than XFCE the Graphical System still takes 10-15 Seconds to load up where as XFCE was the fastest compare to both of them both in Application launch time and also the load time...
 But in long run XFCE is unstable I updated some packages After that dbus was not working properly I tried various solution and I think that the issue it was causing to me was that I was not able to change my wallpaper which got fixed after a few more updates after two or three I think that thing was fixed without my consideration....
 My final choice in the end was GNOME because I do think that its pretty stable and I dont have to wait for a minute or half at least to my graphical system load up but I still think XFCE is the best and you can go on and on LXDE, Cinnamon, Mate and Deepin (which I think is bloat as hell)
 I have tried Deepin and Cinnamon other then the main three

 what i noticed
 1.its much faster than debian based ditros and even faster than endeavour os and manjaro.dont get me wrong but i feel like arch is miles ahead in terms of its swiftness when compared to debian and to my surprise its even faster than arch based manjaro and endeavour os.even though i install the same de (kde plasma and kde apps and same set of other apps. what might be the reason?
 tips i need
  
i have been using arch based ones for a year and half. do i have to do extra steps to maintain properly or same set of steps are enough??
 what are the suggestions that you wish the veterans gave you.when you installed vanilla arch?
  
thank you!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ERMAC è un banking trojan ossia un componente malevolo sviluppato per sottrarre principalmente le credenziali di accesso utilizzate dalle vittime per accedere ai conti correnti bancari online.La seconda versione del malware per Android è stata scoperta in questi giorni ed è attualmente venduta sul 'mercato nero' al prezzo di 5.000 dollari al mese. I criminali informatici utilizzano infatti ERMAC per sottrarre le credenziali altrui e trasferire fondi usando decine di servizi di online banking. La quota richiesta mensilmente dagli sviluppatori dà un'idea di quali possano essere i ricavi dei criminali.La novità è che ERMAC 2.0 porta a ben 467 il numero delle app Android supportate: ciò significa che il trojan è capace di rubare password e dati di accesso per la gestione di un gran numero di conti online di tanti istituti di credito a livello mondiale. Il malware è inoltre capace di trasferire fondi dai portafogli di criptovalute altrui.Uno strumento come ERMAC 2.0 viene sfruttato non soltanto per appropriarsi del denaro altrui ma anche per porre in essere varie forme di frodi finanziarie.Allo stato attuale ERMAC 2.0 viene integrato in app Android presentate come legittime oppure si prova ad aumentarne la diffusione attraverso la comparsa di falsi messaggi di avviso, durante la navigazione sul Web, che informano circa l'utilizzo di una versione obsoleta del browser.Lo spiegano i ricercatori di Cyble che descrivono nel dettaglio il comportamento di ERMAC 2.0.Il malware, una volta in esecuzione sul dispositivo Android della vittima, raccoglie l'elenco delle app installate e lo invia a un server Command and Control (C&C).]]></summary>

Con una modica spesa è possibile gestire a distanza qualunque dispositivo installato a casa e in ufficio, interagire con i sistemi di illuminazione, aprire porte e attivare prese elettriche.Gli switch Sonoff MINI R2 in offerta a soli 22,23 euro nella confezione da 3 pezzi permettono di controllare da remoto qualunque dispositivo usando ad esempio il proprio smartphone o un'applicazione Web. L'attivazione o la disattivazione dei dispositivi collegati con gli switch Sonoff MINI R2 può anche essere pianificata o richiesta con i comandi vocali di Alexa e Google Assistant.La spedizione dei Sonoff MINI R2 avviene dall'Italia: effettuando un ordine oggi si sarà certi di riceverlo in breve tempo e senza affrontare alcuna spesa aggiuntiva al momento della consegna (assicurarsi che nella pagina dell'ordine sia selezionata la voce Italy Warehouse).

I Sonoff MINI R2 possono essere nascosti in qualunque scatola di derivazione o in una presa a muro: le dimensioni compatte (4,26 x 4,26 x 2 cm) assicurano infatti massima versatilità.Ciascun MINI R2 presenta una morsettiera con vari contatti: a S1/S2 si può collegare un interruttore esterno, a Lin e Lout la fase in ingresso e in uscita, a N1/N2 i neutri.Con un semplice collegamento elettrico si può fare in modo che il MINI R2 fornisca o meno alimentazione al dispositivo collegato a valle attivando contemporaneamente più modalità di gestione: tramite un classico interruttore, una pulsantiera, l'applicazione installabile sui dispositivi mobili o mediante comando vocale.MINI R2 si collega al router via WiFi 4 (è compatibile 802.11 b/g/n) e diventa gestibile sia in locale che sul cloud.]]></summary>

 I am trying to cast my screen to my tv. Until now I have tried:
 ​
 VLC Player:
 Playback/Renderer but there it's scanning for devices forever
 ​
 gnome-network-displays (both aur and chaotic-aur):
 Terminal output after starting it:
 ** (gnome-network-displays:37509): WARNING **: 10:55:29.151: Error initing screencast portal: Failed to create portal session (response: 2) 
 ** (gnome-network-displays:37509): WARNING **: 10:55:29.151: Falling back to X11! You need to fix your setup to avoid issues (XDG Portals and/or mutter screencasting support)!
 (^ Whatever this means ^)
 There it finds at least my tv. When I select it, it starts more or less. Also my tv recognizes it. But then it crashes with:
 ** (gnome-network-displays:37509): WARNING **: 10:55:36.867: WfdClient: No resolution found, falling back to standard FullHD resolution.
 fish: Job 1, 'gnome-network-displays' terminated by signal SIGSEGV (Address boundary error)
 ​
 gnome-network-displays from flatpak
 This works and I can see my screen on my tv, but it crashes after some seconds (~30s)
 ​
 Do I need to install something? Or why is it only working with flatpak?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there, can anyone help me how to fix choppy sound on my bluetooth headset? It bugs me out to be only able to listen to 2 seconds of music followed by 5 without.
 I tried so far:disabling bluetooth coexistence as mentioned here:https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Network_configuration/Wireless#Bluetooth_coexistence;
 setting the default fragment number and buffer size in PulseAudio:https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PulseAudio/Troubleshooting#Setting_the_default_fragment_number_and_buffer_size_in_PulseAudio and experimented with different values without improvement;
 changed the latency:https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/bluetooth_headset#Connecting_works,_but_there_are_sound_glitches_all_the_time and tried different values as well;
 all with no improvements or changes. I'm also on a 5G wifi so there shouldn't be any issues as well. 
 EDIT: I've just noticed that sound works well when only one of my earbuds is used, as soon as the other one comes into play the sound is choppy again

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had to go back and have a look at the wiki to ensure I wasn't going crazy, but the Arch Linux principles are, and have always been, pretty crystal clear. While the language has been refined over the years, they are still the same in spirit as they were 10+ years ago when I first read them. If you haven't done so, consider giving the Arch Linux overview a read.
 Yes, it does bother me when someone posts a thread to this sub questioning the quality of a product that they get at no cost, complaining about problems caused by upstream bugs, and also complaining about solutions offered by community members. It bothers me a great deal and if you have read and agree with the Arch Linux principles, it should bother you, too.
 I do respond to such threads with links to the wiki and snark, because I'm genuinely offended at the implications of such posts. The implication being that Arch isn't meeting the user's needs in certain areas, and that someone else is responsible for shoring up those shortcomings to fulfill their expectations. And what really gets my goat, is that what they often consider failures of the distro are actually features, in light of user centrality. It would be far more constructive for a user to check for/open bug reports, and would constitute an actual semblance of contribution to the community, instead of complaining.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Arch entry kept disappearing from my GRUB. Yes, even after a successful install following the Wiki closely. I noticed that this was happening to a lot of people, so I'd like to share a simple solution that I found that fixes this problem permanently. 
 After you install the GRUB and the efibootmgr, and after you run grub-mkconfig and get confirmation that it was done, here's what you do. 
 Go into your boot diretory by typing 
 # cd boot
 # ls (this will list the contents of this directory. EFI should be in there)
 # cd efi
 # ls (whatever you named your GRUB id should show up here. I named mine ARCH, so I'll just use that in this example)
 # mkdir boot (you'll need to create a boot directory here)
 # cd ARCH (now, remember, I named mine ARCH, yours will be different. If you followed the Wiki precisely, yours will be named GRUB)
 # ls (this will list the contents of this directory. There should be just one entry called grubx64.efi)
 # cp grubx64.efi ../boot/bootx64.efi (copy this boot file into the boot folder so that it can be read by the GRUB)
 # exit
 # reboot
 That's it. It'll work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am maintaining a particular AUR package that has just added a new dependency. This new dependency is a very simple python package containing only a single .py file, a tests.py, LICENSE, and README.md.
 I can see that the GitHub repo for the new dependency also contains some of the new standard python packaging: pyproject.toml and setup.cfg. The pytproject.toml specifies the build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta".
 However, this is the first python package I have attempted to package for the AUR which appears to be using setuptools but does not have a setup.py file. I attempted to use the "Standards based" approach on the current version of https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Python_package_guidelines but no wheel is found in the packaging step:
 Traceback (most recent call last): File "/usr/lib/python3.10/runpy.py", line 196, in _run_module_as_main return _run_code(code, main_globals, None, File "/usr/lib/python3.10/runpy.py", line 86, in _run_code exec(code, run_globals) File "/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/installer/__main__.py", line 85, in <module> _main(sys.argv[1:], "python -m installer") File "/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/installer/__main__.py", line 73, in _main with WheelFile.open(args.wheel) as source: File "/usr/lib/python3.10/contextlib.py", line 135, in __enter__ return next(self.gen) File "/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/installer/sources.py", line 122, in open with zipfile.ZipFile(path) as f: File "/usr/lib/python3.10/zipfile.py", line 1249, in __init__ self.fp = io.open(file, filemode) FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'dist/*.whl' 
 The README.md of course, recommends simply pip install but this is not acceptable for a dependency of the primary AUR package which I maintian. How should I proceed? How do you package python scripts for the AUR appropriately without building a wheel as per the wiki or using a setup.py as I have always done previously?

However, deciding on a search engine is a highly personal choice. As it stands today, Google is the most popular, Bing is playing catchup, and DuckDuckGo is trying a privacy-centric approach. So how do you know which one is right for you? Let’s compare Google, Bing and DuckDuckGo and see where each search giant succeeds and where they fall behind the competition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had to run some CUDA stuffs so to get the best performance I often ran them in TTY. However, after a few seconds the programs started to complain about insufficient VRAM.
 Through nvtop I could see that, in TTY, VRAM was quickly being used up. But this didn't happen in normal DE (Plasma). There were only Xorg, plasmashell, and steam using the GPU. Weirdly, nvtop didn't show that steam was using more VRAM, only that the total memory usage getting fill up. Completely quit steam temporarily solved the issue. But it happened again after reopening steam.
 After one hour troubleshooting, I ended up delete ~/.local/share/steam and let it reinstall and that seemed to finally fix it. Don't exactly know what could have caused steam to behave like that.
 PS: Now I know that steam consistently uses about 100 MB of VRAM just sitting in the tray, I might have to reconsider letting it run in the background.

 "why don't you just patch them yourself locally?"
 because not everyone has those abilities and it would be nice for everyone to have a nice, clean running Arch env.
 "Why don't you just downgrade those packages?"
 because that may break dependencies, etc
  
 1) This may speak to a couple people but the latest update to systemd has an annoying shutdown message and beep https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=276662
  
 2) kernel output regression every single time you start your computer: https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/69155 been waiting for this one for almost 2 months now to be fixed.

I also tested other distributions: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Manjaro 21.2.6, Debian 11 but the problem is still there, and laptop hangs in infinite loop on OS loading splash screen. Im basically unable to boot any linux distribution.. Is it even possible to fix this problem ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft aveva annunciato lo scorso anno l'intenzione di unire la 'versione moderna' della sua app OneNote per Windows 10 e 11 con la più tradizionale release Win32. Il progetto è stato parzialmente portato a termine con il nuovo OneNote che già unisce i due mondi e include alcune nuove caratteristiche, con altre funzioni che saranno via via introdotte nei mesi a seguire.Su Windows 10 e Windows 11 non si dovranno insomma più gestire due applicazioni OneNote separate perché tutto risulta ora condensato in un'unica app.L'app OneNote aggiornata ha un layout simile alla versione classica ma presenta un aspetto completamente rinnovato per adattarsi a Windows 11. C'è ancora l'interfaccia a schede nella parte superiore della finestra per passare da uno strumento all'altro ma per chi è abituato alla visualizzazione più semplice di OneNote per Windows 11 è disponibile un pulsante che permette di passare a una barra multifunzione semplificata.A parte gli aspetti estetici, che hanno comunque la loro valenza, il nuovo OneNote si mette in evidenza per il supporto e il riconoscimento della scrittura ('ink').]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Usb stick doesn't get recognised after installing custom kernel (tkg-pds) .
 While USB does work on the default kernel ,fdisk -l on the custom kernel doesnt show anything besides the internal hard drives .
 ​
 modprobe: FATAL: Module usb-storage not found in directory /lib/modules/5.17.9-258-tkg-pds 
 Edit : SOLVED/it was due to an option being enabled in the customization file to use modeprobed db to clean the cfg from unneeded modules while not having build the database of loaded modules with "modprobed-db store" before compiling the kernel ... Or just disable that option altogether.
