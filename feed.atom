        <updated>2022-04-16T00:05:06.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost a year ago I acquired a thinkpad p1 gen 3 from my employer, and of course immediately wiped Windows in favor of Arch with GNOME. As with every install, I wanted to play with what was new in the linux world so I set up my user account using systemd-homed as a BTRFS subvolume (not an encrypted luks loopback). For the most part this has worked out ok. 
 Recently, I wanted to set up the fingerprint reader so I installed and enabled fprint. Theoretically this is supposed to enable the fingerprint enrollement UI inside GNOME settings without further configuration. It did not. I was able to register a print with fprint-enroll and the effects are:
  
fprint-verify works
 GDM prompts that I can use fingerprint to log in, but attempting to do so always fails
 The GNOME lock screen also prompts that I can use fingerprint to unlock, and that works fairly reliably (the sensor itself seems finicky, which squares with what ive read of others' experience with thinkpad fingerprint readers)
 systemd-ask-password prompts (such as when running a systemctl command without sudo, which display via GNOME UI) do not offer fingerprint authentication, nor does it work if i try to press the sensor anyway
 GNOME settings still shows nothing in relation to fingerprint auth in the user management section 
  
I've searched around a bit and I haven't been able to find anything about this issue from other users, so I'm hoping someone around here has some experience with this odd combination of fingerprint auth, GNOME and systemd-homed that can provide some insight.
 Fail that, it's quite difficult to figure out where exactly to open an issue with upstream GNOME or what chat channels are available to work through debugging so maybe some pointers there would be helpful.
 tl;dr fprint + systemd-homed doesn't seem to be picked up by GNOME authentication prompts consistently. Unsure where to seek help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Help me out. What do you call your LVM group? From my perspective I don't see a time where I would ever have more than one group on a computer. I just create multiple volumes/Partitions inside that one group. So it becomes tedious constantly typing a long group name.
 /dev/long group name/volume name
 I have been using "group" as in
 /dev/group/arch
 But I'm thinking of just putting "lvm" or maybe just a single letter "g"
 So I'd get
 /dev/g/arch
 Any problems with that? 
 Follow up question.
 On naming the logical volumes inside my group, can I add descriptive extensions? Can I make a volume named "arch.cutefish" to indicate the desktop installed? 
 So get something like
 /dev/lvm/arch.cutefish

Currently, you can get the Amazon Echo Dot 4th Gen Smart Speaker for under $40.

I understand that using an unsupported distro can cause incompatibility and security issues. ▫️ This is where I have a doubt. I think this is if that distro uses its own repositories, but if it uses the official Arch repositories then it shouldn't be a problem as the system will always be up to date regardless if that distro stops development, as long as it doesn't run his own pre-installed programs (unsupported) should have no problem. Right? ▫️ Example, this can be a problem with distros like Ubuntu but not with Endeavor OS that uses official Arch repositories, as long as they are still online there will be no problem if the Endeavour project comes to an end tomorrow I will not be "forced" to change the OS if I don't want to. ▫️ Am I correct, or is there something I'm not considering? 🤔

 Before tlp: 8-9W After tlp: 8-9W
 After laptop-mode-tools: 5-6W
 Only default configuration in both tools and with terminal opened and 3 tabs in Firefox 30% brightness, Bluetooth off and Wifi connected system wide dark theme No load
 I've read in articles that both tools does same thing and tlp is more updated and better but for me tlp has no effect.
 I've followed every step given in Arch wiki Installed tlp-rdw as well masked necessary things and enabled daemon But no effect tried restarting also.
 System info
 Asus Zenbook ux325
 16GB Ram 512GB nvme ssd
 Arch Linux Kernel 5.17 With Gnome (Tried sway and kde same drain rate) 
 Window system Wayland
 Graphics enabled
 Answer will be appreciated
 I know 5-6W is already very sufficient
 Just curious if tlp would work I may able to reduce power consumption to 4W maybe 😅

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I just did a fresh install of Arch Linux (plain arch, not arch-based like Manjaro) and so far everything looks like it's working just fine and I got the AUR installed with the Paru AUR helper. 
 Unfortunately I just installed Minecraft Launcher and Prusa Slicer (a 3D printing application) and both of these look like they installed properly, I didn't get any error message of any kind in the terminal, but they don't actually open. When I try to open the desktop icon, they just don't do anything. They don't flash a screen or anything, it's like the icon isn't connected to anything. Minecraft was installed through the AUR and Prusa was installed with regular Pacman. Does anyone know how I might be able to fix this? I kind of have a feeling the desktop shortcuts might be bugged, so if anyone can tell me how I could open an app through the terminal, I could give that a shot and see if it was a bad install or if there's something wrong with the shortcut itself. 
 Thank you in advance!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I installed arch Linux on a laptop with Ly desktop manager and KDE Plasma. Wayland sessions are extremely unstable in my case so I use X11. If I switch to another TTY on a fresh boot without logging into Plasma, I can run systemctl suspend and the laptop sleeps as expected. Once I have Plasma running, systemctl suspend or closing the laptop lid causes the screen to go black but the laptop never enters a suspended state. There is no way that I know to recover the system at this point. Even if I killall plasmashell first, and try to suspend, the problem persists. Plasma power management settings are configured appropriately, so it’s not that simple. Anyone have any tips?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'm tempted to switch to Arch Linux because of the rolling release principle. I'm kinda tired of fully updating the distro when a new release comes up, always with fresh installs and so on because something (almost all the time), doesn't get updated as intended and stuff break. What holds me back are the people which are complaining about how much time Arch requires to be maintained. I kinda don't have this luxury: time.
 ​
 I've managed to install Arch one (wayland, btrfs, kde), on my machine. It seems stable. 
 I have a ThinkPad T590 with i7-8665U, UHD 620, 1TB NVMe (any tips on mounting the NVMe more efficiently? I'm giving it the ssd flag). 
 What are your thoughts? 
 Many thanks!

Abbiamo anche visto come con WhatsApp Business si possa usare WhatsApp senza numero telefonico mobile specificando una numerazione fissa, cosa particolarmente utile per aziende e professionisti che vogliono restare sempre in contatto con i loro clienti.Posto che WhatsApp sempre più utilizzato anche per lavoro, l'azienda direttamente controllata da Facebook-Meta ha deciso di introdurre una nuova funzionalità nel client di messaggistica istantanea che ha uno stampo spiccatamente 'social'.La novità si chiama WhatsApp Community e si tratta di uno strumento che permette a organizzazioni, istituzioni scolastiche, associazioni locali ed enti no profit di aggregare più gruppi separati in un unico gruppo omnicomprensivo.L'idea è quella di creare comunità articolate con la possibilità, da parte degli amministratori, di inviare messaggi a tutti gli utenti oppure a singoli sottogruppi.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Già da qualche mese, dopo il lancio dei processori Alder Lake, si è cominciato a parlare di quella che sembra a tutti gli effetti il processore di punta della prossima generazione di casa Intel.Il Core i9-13900K (gamma Raptor Lake-S) sarà realizzato ricorrendo a un processo produttivo Intel 7: si tratta del nodo a 10 nm con una densità di transistor superiore al nodo a 7 nm di TSMC. Sappiamo già, inoltre, che sarà una CPU dotata di 24 core fisici e 32 thread.Il balzo in avanti in termini di core del processore e di thread è figlio di un notevole aumento dei core ad alta efficienza energetica (core E) mentre i core a più elevate prestazioni (core P) rimarranno allo stesso livello dei corrispettivi usati negli attuali Alder Lake-S.Ciò significa che un prodotto come Intel Core i9-13900K poggerà su 8 core ad alte prestazioni basati sull'architettura Raptor Cove e 16 core ad alta efficienza Gracemont.

L'utilizzo della tecnologia HyperThreading interesserà solo i core ad alte prestazioni: ed è per questo motivo che i thread supportati dal Core i9-13900K saranno 32 e non 48.]]></summary>

Federal and State Governments Requiring Use of ID.me
    
The Internal Revenue Service required the public to use ID.me to access their tax-related records. State governments used it to allow residents to verify their identities when applying for unemployment assistance during the pandemic.
    
There are no federal laws regulating the use of facial recognition to ensure privacy protections during its use. The General Services Administration warned of problems with facial recognition, and the House of Representatives held a hearing about it in 2019, but nothing was resolved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello r/archlinux!
 I hope all of you are well. 
 I've recently encountered an issue on one of my machines. It seems that QT apps are using a different emoji set compared to GTK+ apps. I find this a little bit odd because I use the exact same fontconfig on all of my machines (copied across machines both in /etc and ~/.config) and I don't have the issue on the other machines at all.
 Here's a screenshot of what I am talking about: Screenshot
 Left (GTK) = xfce4-terminal & xed
 Right (QT) = qterminal (my terminal of choice) & kate
 It seems that QT apps are using the older Noto "blob" style emoji rather than the current Noto ones (which are applied system-wide except for qt apps). 
 I have been searching for a solution for the past 2 hours, reviewing the Fonts section on the Arch wiki and conducting several web searches, to no avail. 
 I'm hoping that I could be guided to the right direction on this one. I assume it's a package involving plasma/qt5 that installs an embedded emoji blobs font, but I can't seem to find the package or figure that out yet (also, I could be wrong).
 Why are emojis a concern?: I am currently working on a minimal website with emojis and I am using some emojis from the latest unicode (u14). My editors of choice are Kate and Vim running on qterminal. Unfortunately with my preferences, having the older emoji blobs on qt applications means most of the new emojis (even from 3-4 years back) are not displayed on the screen. 
 Any help would be sincerely appreciated.
 Thank you very much.

So the system clearly identifies my mute LED, but it's not working somehow.
 I did this workaround to my sound server for microphone to work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Being able to check out notifications on your lock screen can be very convenient. This way you can see at a glance if it’s something important and determine whether it’s worth unlocking your phone or not. But having this information on your lock screen also means you are at risk of sharing more than you’d like to. 
    
The details visible on your lock screen may not always be sensitive, but beyond everything, this info is no one else’s business but yours. A convenient method to keep your data private would be to hide notifications from your Android lock screen. This does not require that you root your phone, and it’s easier than you think.

 It's my hope to develop a workflow that's efficient and intuitive to myself. I'm guessing that's everyone, no matter the system you use.
 I'm currently using KDE (I know), and konsole with the bash and tmux. I've been considering a move to i3, bwspm, or xfce to trim down own resource usage, and focus more on the the tasks I'm performing.
 What does your workflow look like? What tools do you use for system administration?
 Do you write scripts to automate most of your tasks?
 Looking forward to your replies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear fellow Arch enjoyers,
 I have a problem which is not directly related to arch. However, I am sure that I can help myself with your knowhow.
 _________________________________________________________________
 Background:
 When I assembled my first PC 4 years ago, I had no experience at all with PCs, let alone with building them. My colleagues helped me assemble the PC and set up practically everything for me. Among the installed parts was a wireless network card which I connected to my Gigabyte Z370 HD3 mainboard.
 Since the beginning, however, I had a problem, namely that my PC always started up by itself after I had shut it down. After quite a bit of trial and error, I found out that it was the network card which caused the problem.
 I sold it and stayed without wifi and bluetooth for a few years until I recently bought a new network card (Gigabyte GC-WBAX210) and behold, the same problem occurs again.
 ___________________________________________________________________
 Troubleshooting:
 At first I thought of wake on lan or better said wake on wireless lan but all settings in the BIOS and in the network manager are disabled. I have also tried several interfaces on my mainboard but without success. As with the previous model, the card is connected via a PCIEx1 interface and an internal USB 2 cable. After extensive reading of the wiki and other posts, I am unfortunately still at the same point.
 ____________________________________________________________________
 Request:
 I would therefore like to ask you if you know of any ways of dealing with this problem in arch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having reliable smoke detectors in your home at all times is a must-have, but you usually have to be home to know if they’re going off. With the X-Sense Wi-Fi Smoke Detector, you’re notified wherever you may be. This can help you take action in an emergency even if you’re at work, out shopping, or on vacation.  I was lucky enough to get to try a three-pack out for myself.
    
This is a sponsored article and was made possible by X-Sense. The actual contents and opinions are the sole views of the author who maintains editorial independence even when a post is sponsored.
    
Overview of Features
    
For my review, I received the X-Sense Wi-Fi Smoke Detector three-pack, but you can also buy a single smoke detector. The first thing you’ll notice is how compact and small they are. They’re noticeably smaller than standard smoke detectors at 3 in. x 3 in. x 1.9 in. However, this doesn’t mean they’re less capable of getting the job done.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am experiencing random app freezes in i3wm. The app itself freezes, but i3wm and other programs works normally. They unfreeze themselves after 10 - 20 seconds. Switching workspace during a freeze event causes the "screenshot" of the previous workspace to remain on the frozen app's window.
  
The behavior is observed to appear on VSCode, Anbox, Electron, etc ... Now it's happening more than 3 times in a few hours.
 Such behavior don't appear on GNOME, no matter running on Xorg or Wayland.
 During such freeze, I don't observe any CPU / Memory high usage. I only have Intel GPU and should be running xf86-intel GPU driver.
 I don't use compton, but I do run gsd-xsettings on i3 startup if that matters.
  
Any help would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quando ci si accinge a cambiare router o comunque ad acquistarne uno nuovo, sono tante le specifiche tecniche sulle quali bisogna soffermarsi.Le sigle che appaiono nel nome del modello del router già offrono preziose indicazioni sulla tipologia di dispositivo.- BE, AX, AC, N. Sigle di questo tipo presenti nel nome del router stanno a significare lo standard supportato dal dispositivo.Nei router più recenti compare la sigla AX a indicare che il prodotto supporta lo standard WiFi 6 (802.11 ax)Sulla carta WiFi 6 consente di raggiungere velocità di trasferimento dati fino a 9,6 Gbps anche se all'atto pratico è estremamente difficile avvicinarsi a questo valore. Molto dipende anche dai dispositivi WiFi collegati: se non sono compatibili WiFi 6 e se non possono i canali più ampi le prestazioni massime risulteranno molto più ridotte: ne parliamo nel dettaglio nell'articolo che abbiamo citato poco sopra.La sigla AC fa riferimento al supporto per lo standard WiFi 5 (WiFi 5) che sulla carta non permette di superare i 6,9 Gbps in condizioni ottimali.La sigla N indica i router più vecchi che supportano solo WiFi 4 (802.11 n) e che sono contraddistinti da prestazioni complessivamente più mediocri.Tutti i router AX, AC e N possono lavorare sulle frequenze dei 2,4 GHz e dei 5 GHz.L'indicazione BE non è ancora utilizzata e sarà parte integrante del nome del modello di tutti quei router compatibili WiFi 7.- WiFi 6E.]]></summary>
