 So I did a fresh install of EndeavourOS and when I installed discord, it did not work as expected. I could log in, but afterwards it didn't respond and was very glitchy and unresponsive.
 I tried installing from flatpak, all of the other versions... none worked.
 I even tried with GNOME instead of i3wm, it crashed on startup.
 However, in my other laptop discord is perfectly fine and stable, while using Arch too.
 ​
 Any ideas?

 xfce4-screensaver is the offending program. I pacman -Rns 'd it and when I close my laptop lip, I get a black screen I can't escape from. I have to press CTRL + ALT + F2 in order to get to a text-based login screen, where I can poweroff the computer.
 Clicking the Lock Screen Button, Logging Out, and Restarting still all work properly displaying "dm-tool lock".
 How can I set "dm-tool lock" in place of wherever xfce4-screensaver was active?
  
 I am running a nearly fresh install of Arch Linux with XFCE4.
 I would like to mandate that the only screen locker ever used is "dm-tool lock" which I think is called "LightDM GTK Greeter".
 I've run a few commands now that I honestly don't remember (important thing is they don't work).
 I am able to mandate "dm-tool lock" for all cases so far except when I close the lid on my laptop randomly.
 I am met on opening it with a strange different screen locker that looks similar but has none of my settings, no clock panel, etc.
 How do I...
  
Purge the false screen locker from my system for eternity
 Mandate "dm-tool lock" as the one locker to rule them all
  
 BONUS ROUND
 Is there any reason "dm-tool lock" is not worthy of being my screen locker? Is it secure in all cases?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 So recently I've decided to create an interesting project: Use FreeBSD as a guest with my dGPU via GPU Passthrough. But it's got a lot of caveats to it and I wonder if someone could help me.
 The first reason why I'm not installing straight into my machine is because it's a Surface Book (1st Gen - Performance Base Edition) which doesn't even recognize the keyboard after trying to install it via an external one. So it has to have a Linux kernel and run it as a guest.
 The second problem is that despite running almost perfectly, the laptop requires a custom kernel called surface-linux in order to have stable WiFi connection and recognize the NVIDIA dGPU.
 Following along, the third problem was switching between the iGPU and the dGPU. In that case, I've opted for the optimus-manager project in order to switch between them. It's works great with Arch.
 So the only way I could run FreeBSD with the NVIDIA dGPU would be by using a Type 1 Hypervisor such as KVM. That would be the only way to get the GPU Passthrough.
 I've read ArchWiki article regarding GPU Passthrough extensively. I was able to isolate the NVIDIA dGPU, by loading only the vfio-pci drivers when turning on, but I'm still not able to connect with the VM using it.
 One thing to notice is that when using lspci the NVIDIA dGPU appear as 3D Graphics, and not VGA. I'm pretty sure this is the reason why I cannot fully detach it.
 Can anyone help me with this project?

 My monitor connected via a USB-C dock connected to my laptop will show the login screen, but as soon as the KDE Wayland session is started the monitor will show "No signal". The monitor will still be "detected", my laptop's display (which is working correctly) will not be the primary display, as if the external monitor is still functioning. If I connect the monitor after starting the KDE session, everything works normally. I haven't tried recreating this issue on X because even if that fixed the issue, I need to scale my laptop monitor separately from my external monitor.
 I'm not sure how to debug this issue myself so if anyone could tell me where to start looking or a possible fix for this issue, please let me know.

I don't like having the kernel exposed in fat partition, so I decided to make a esp at /boot/efi and a reliable xfs extended boot partition (/boot) in theory since systemd 250 you can load EFI drivers which are on EFI/systems/drivers on the esp so I put the efifs driver in there and followed the systemd-boot installation, but when I reboot I get an error that the xfs_64.efi image couldn't be loaded (load error) and subsequently the kernel and initrd fails to start.
 I have tried to load the driver from the EFI shell and loads just fine and I can read from the partition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[None of us really planned for it to happen this way, but for some reason, we end up using our smartphones for many of our computing tasks, despite the small, single screen and lack of multitasking options that make it more limited. The unlocked SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G Smartphone solves that by offering two side-by-side screens that combine to become a larger screen. If you’re unsure, read on, as it’s currently $500 off.
    
Folded, it’s a smartphone that fits in your pocket, yet unfolded, it becomes a slim tablet. The 7.6″ 120Hz AMOLED 2X screen is clear, with everything appearing larger than on a standard smartphone. 25W Super Fast Charging (sold separately or as an add-on) and the 4,400mAh battery increase your options even more.
   
 
   
Galaxy Flex Mode allows you to fold it at any angle and hold it however is comfortable to you. Three multi-windows allow you to check your calendar while editing and create presentations from multiple sources. If you add on an S Pen (sold separately), it... Read more]]></summary>

The experience has been good so far except some minor lags and FPS drops, that are a result of using an Nvidia GPU with KDE desktop. I've found that the best solution to this problem is to simply switch to the integrated Intel GPU since I don't really use the PC for anything other than casual Internet usage and homework. My question here Is: is removing the nvidia package enough ? I would like to know your opinion, specially if you've got a better solution to the lag problem...

With AirDroid Cast, it’s as easy as installing the software and entering a code. It’s designed to simplify screen casting and mirroring so that you can focus on sharing what’s on your phone or computer screen with others. I recently had the pleasure of seeing how well AirDroid worked in action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Friends.
 I launched the curated user repository a few weeks ago and now comes the package manager to go with it.
 AUR packages are reviewed and whitelisted. Additional package recipes are directly shipped with the curated repo.
 So far it works really well. But it is brand-new - so please bear with me, if something goes wrong. Please file a github issue, if you encounter a bug.
 Right now, the basic feature set is implemented. You can use it to install and remove packages. Additional features are planned in the future. Please give it a try and let me know in the comments, if there is something you wish to have.
 Also... Feel free to file a github pull request, if there is a package you'd like to have included.
 I created a helper script, that makes it very easy to add additional packages to the AUR whitelist. If you want to bump a package version, simply re-run the script with the package name and it will update to the latest version:
  $ aur-whitelist build2 # whitelist build2 4424cce8e2f4d87fa54b1b53a354dec7d784e8f9 build2 $ aur-whitelist build2 # already up-to-date already accepted, skipping: build2 
 -- flydude
 P.S.: Some of you might wonder, if this qualifies as an AUR helper. Not really, I'd say. We do include high-quality packages from the AUR. But the packages are reviewed and maintained inside a single git repo. Therefore it's more like Gentoo Portage (hence the name).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tecnici di Amazon hanno annunciato di essere al lavoro su un nuovo progetto basato sull'intellligenza artificiale che in futuro andrà ad arricchire le abilità di Alexa.L'assistente digitale Alexa sarà infatti in grado di emulare qualunque voce e parlare con il timbro di un proprio caro o di un personaggio famoso.Secondo Amazon basta sottoporre ad Alexa un breve spezzone del parlato (circa un minuto; la voce può essere anche registrata) perché l'assistente digitale sia in grado di esprimersi usando 'parole sue', mai ascoltate in precedenza, ma adoperando le caratteristiche vocali di un qualunque individuo.La bizzarra rivelazione è stata resa durante la conferenza annuale re:Mars di Amazon: Rohit Prasad, vicepresidente senior della società e responsabile del progetto Alexa, ha descritto in dettaglio una serie di nuove funzionalità in arrivo. Il momento più toccante è stato senza dubbio quando l'assistente Alexa ha letto una storia a un bambino prima di andare a dormire usando la voce della nonna defunta.È bastato usare un solo minuto di audio registrato della donna perché Alexa creasse un'impronta vocale da usare per qualunque tipo di interazione.'Il modo in cui abbiamo potuto realizzare tutto questo è stato inquadrare il problema come un'attività di conversione vocale e non come un percorso di generazione del parlato', ha fatto presente Prasad.Amazon non ha lasciato intendere quando la nuova caratteristica potrebbe debuttare in Alexa.C'è da dire che sarà importante verificare quali limitazioni Amazon deciderà di imporre su una funzione del genere che, ovviamente, potrebbe essere utilizzata anche per scopi tutt'altro che legittimi ovvero nell'ambito dei furti d'identità.Abbiamo detto in passato che l'impronta vocale non può essere considerato come uno strumento biometrico utile ad autenticare gli utenti.Google stessa, con lo strumento VoiceMatch, fa sì che il suo assistente digitale si attivi e restituisca informazioni soltanto quando viene riconosciuta una voce nota.]]></summary>

Il messaggio di solito appare su una schermata a sfondo nero e può presentarsi nelle varianti No boot device found, No boot device available e simili.Il messaggio d'errore certifica il fatto che il sistema non è riuscito a trovare un'unità di memorizzazione avviabile. Questo può succedere perché l'hard disk o l'unità SSD risultano danneggiati, perché i file di avvio sono corrotti, perché non è collegata alcuna unità avviabile, per via di impostazioni non corrette a livello di BIOS.Per risolvere l'errore Boot device not found e similari è bene andare per gradi.
Boot device not found: verificare se l'unità è riconosciuta e la sequenza di avvio
 Il primo passaggio da compiere per superare l'errore Boot device not found e ripristinare l'avvio di Windows consiste nell'accedere al BIOS quindi portarsi nella sezione Boot options per verificare, innanzitutto, che l'hard disk o l'unità SSD contenente Windows sia correttamente riconosciuta.In caso affermativo è fondamentale verificare l'impostazione Boot sequence o Boot order: come prima unità deve essere selezionata quella che contiene Windows.Dopo aver effettuato un'eventuale variazione sulla configurazione del BIOS, è necessario salvare le modifiche (Exit saving changes) e lasciare che la macchina si riavvii automaticamente.Come ha confermato anche lo sviluppatore di VeraCrypt può capitare che l'installazione di un aggiornamento di Windows porti alla modifica indesiderata della sequenza di boot.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I am looking for a guide to dual-boot my existing Windows 11 installation, with Arch, on my Asus TUF Dash F15 FX516PC. The laptop has BitLocker enabled on both my C, and D drive, and since I am not very familiar with disk encryption/decryption procedures, I was looking for a definitive guide to do this. I have installed Arch before, on hardware, but never as a dual-boot (with BitLocker) OS, and I also read the Arch-Wiki but it doesn't talk much about BitLocker. So, can someone point me to a resource regarding this (preferably with Windows 11 and BitLocker. Installation steps on a similar laptop like mine, would be a huge plus)?
 Thanks
 ​
 Edit: The Arch Wiki, also states that disabling secure boot, will also disable windows updates, so is there any way to fix that? Another thing I forgot to add, is that I plan to install Arch on the same disk, on separate partitions, since I don't have a separate disk at the moment.

 So I cam Currently using arch Linux with the latest Linux-zen kernel. The issue that I am facing is that with the router in front of me, I am getting around 60% Signal Strength and if I go to the next room, the signal strength drops to around 25% and my WiFi Gets disconnected. This does not happen with other devices / laptops. The network that i am trying to connect is operating on the 5Ghz band.
 I also went and installed the Latest driver from Intel's Website Intel WiFi Driver Link (https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/drivers/iwlwifi) and copied this under /lib/firmware but it made no change to my Signal Drop issue. I also tried the latest Linux kernel. It did not solve my issue. This did not happen with Ubuntu 20.04 which I was running earlier. Can someone guide me in the right direction as I'm kinda lost now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xiaomi ha annunciato il suo primo 2-in-1 con Windows 11 e SoC ARM. Si tratta del nuovo Xiaomi Book S 12,4', un dispositivo interessante che presenta un telaio in alluminio-magnesio e dimensioni pari a 294 x 197 x 8,95 mm con un peso di 720 grammi.Lo schermo è da 31,4 cm e supporta una risoluzione 2K nativa (2560 x 1600 pixel) con una luminosità di 500 nits. Copre il 100% della gamma colore DCI-P3, è protetto con un vetro Corning Gorilla Glass 3 e ha un rapporto d'aspetto pari a 16:10 con frequenza di refresh di 60 Hz.

        <updated>2022-06-23T09:21:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit: The kernel documentation on uinput says it's for "emulating input devices from userspace", and the examples there are also for sending inputs, so I don't think this can be used to record inputs. From what I've seen you'd need access to the files in the /dev/input/ folder for that, which is limited to root or those in the input group on my system. I'm not an expert though, so take that with a grain of salt.
 So when I was trying out ydotool (essentially xdotool except it also works on Wayland) I noticed that it did not ask for root privileges at all and worked just fine, and my user is not even in the input group as the AUR package says is required.
 After digging deeper I noticed that I have read-write access to /dev/uinput (which is the file ydotool needs access to, and is why it usually won't just work), and it turns out it's because of a udev rule installed by the Steam package as part of /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/70-steam-input.rules, specifically this one:
 ```
 Steam Controller udev write access
 KERNEL=="uinput", SUBSYSTEM=="misc", OPTIONS+="static_node=uinput", TAG+="uaccess", OPTIONS+="static_node=uinput" ```
 The Steam Controller known issues page does say that it's needed for the gamepad emulation mode.
 So, essentially if you have Steam installed even if you're on Wayland any app can mess with mouse and keyboard inputs, just like in X11. Is this supposed to be common knowledge? I didn't see it mentioned in the Arch Wiki page for Steam.
 On the bright side, I guess it means that the complaint about Wayland breaking the input automation use case is kind of moot with things like this lol.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Storicamente Facebook ha messo a disposizione degli utenti che si servono di dispositivi mobili due applicazioni: una permette di consultare il social network e gestire le pagine, l'altra è un client di messaggistica istantanea.Il client di messaggistica si chiama Messenger e quando si naviga all'interno del social network da browser Web su desktop, notebook, tablet e convertibili risulta integrato nell'interfaccia di Facebook. Basta cliccare sull'icona raffigurante un fumetto con all'interno il simbolo di un fulmine per accedere alla schermata a comparsa Chat.

Sui dispositivi mobili, invece, le app Facebook e Messenger sono separate: ciascuna di esse occupa almeno 50-65 MB di spazio e ha una diversa occupazione in termini di memoria RAM.Installando l'app Facebook e toccando l'icona di Messenger nella barra in alto, l'applicazione invita l'utente a caricare sul dispositivo mobile anche Messenger.

Ha senso tenere due applicazioni simultaneamente in esecuzione sullo smartphone quando potrebbero essere integrate in una sola app? Secondo noi, no.
Come usare Facebook con Messenger
 Fortunatamente esiste un semplice trucco per usare Facebook con Messenger integrati in un'unica app.Gli utenti possessori di un dispositivo Android possono infatti installare e usare Facebook Lite: si tratta di una versione più compatta del client Facebook che integra anche la messaggistica di Messenger (sarebbe dovuta arrivare anche su iOS ma ad oggi non è ancora accaduto).Pur essendo molto più leggera rispetto alle app citate in precedenza Facebook Lite offre sia la possibilità di usare Facebook che Messenger.]]></summary>

At the final step of installing grub, we saw that there wasn't enough space in the boot partition. The default boot partition that came with this laptop is 100MB. So used sfdisk to completely move some partitions over to create space for the boot partition to take. Then we expanded the boot partition to be 490MB using cfdisk. We also triple checked that the partition table was actually written. After mounting the boot partition to /mnt/boot and running df -h, it shows that the partition only has 96M??? Why might such a thing happen, and how can we fix it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To briefly summarize I'm having difficulty updating my key rings that work with databases and I think this is an issue with my ISP which will be resolved in some time. I normally use Required to prevent MITM attacks, but the database key rings are no longer working so I have temporarily disabled the need for them. What is the security risk for allowing unsigned databases in comparison to packages? I think I'm still secure as the execution of an unsigned package is what I would assume allows for MITM attacks but I just want to double check about other potential security risks. The only problem I could think of is someone perhaps imitating the database and giving me a malicious package with a proper package signature, but I'm not certain if that is feasible or if I should be concerned about other security risks.

 $ "ls -1 /usr/share/xgreeters" - gtk/webkit2.desktop both show up.

 systemctl status lightdm -- loaded enabled and active?? which is the confusing part.

Disattivare queste funzioni, rimuovere le app inutili o inutilizzate, dare una regolata alla privacy, dopo ogni reinstallazione di Windows richiederebbe qualche altra ora di ricerche e di lavoro, oltre ad avere delle competenze di cui non tutti gli utenti dispongono.

 This problem started about a week ago. It also happens with different file formats/extensions, e.g., .ogg and .wav. Finally, the alternative tools pw-record and arecord both record and playback fine, while the tool parecord begins recording promptly, but during playback the audio cuts out earlier than when I sent Ctrl-c.
 In this attached screenshot, you can see that the first two lines printed don't show any registering of audio. Only at the third line do we see anything registered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I am very new to archlinux and relearning linux in general after about 8 years.
 So to start off, I am dualbooted, windows 10 and Arch GNOME. I used a 250GB ssd to create arch on and it runs super smooth and I love it. However the issue started with... disk space. My pc has 2 SSDs, 1HDD, an M.2 and a Hybrid drive. I decided to go into windows, delete everything off my 500GB HDD and its all good.
 I used GParted to format the HDD and even mounted it. The problem is, its not showing up in my files system. It still shows under "Other locations" unless I launch nautilus by $sudo nautilus.
 When I go to steam (To create a file to download games to), and go to settings, downloads and Steam Library Folders, I try to use the dev/sdc1 and it says its read only... But the permissions are all fixed to read and write and I am the owner not root. The ONLY thing I can think of is when I go into the permissions, Change Permissions and Enclosed Files option shows group and others as read only... but when I change that, it reverts when I go back in.
 Owner:Me
 Access:Create and delete files
 Group: users
 Access:Create and delete files
 Others:
 Access: Create and delete files
 ​
 Again I am very new so I apologize if there is missing info. Whatever you need to know, I will add it

 https://i.imgur.com/bsQVPCz.png
 As you can see, the service is "critical" and thus it needs to finish launching before continuing in the boot process. You can also see that the systemd-networkd-wait-online.service is taking 16 seconds, probably because it's waiting for the whoogle service.
 I am not sure exactly what I should be googling for a result but if any of you guys could help me to make the service not halt the boot of my computer, it would be greatly appreciated! Maybe I could also give this solution to the creator of the AUR packages.
