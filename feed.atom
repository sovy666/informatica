        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working on moving my main desktop from Windows to Linux, and I have some history with Arch so that was my first choice, but I am having a performance issue. I typically run gminer in the background all the time while I am using my system, and this doesn't cause any noticeable impact on Windows.
 I have been trying some different distros, and with PopOS and Fedora using proprietary nvidia drivers for my 3080Ti, I have the same experience where I can mine in the background and it doesn't appear to have any impact on the user experience.
 When I use anything Arch based though and install the nvidia DKMS drivers, I am getting very bad graphical lag when trying to use and move around windows while running gminer, to the point where the system isn't really useable.
 Some additional info: I am using GNOME in all the linux variations I have been testing, and I have enabled the full composition pipeline in nvidia settings on arch, but that didn't seem to make a difference. I have also tried with both normal Linux kernel and Zen kernel. I have tried archcraft, endeavour, manjaro, and xero for arch distributions to see if it was some weird distro specific thing, but I'm having the same issue on all of them.
 Any reason I would only be seeing the poor performance on Arch-based systems, and is there any way to optimize?

 I want to remove the Windows partitions nvme0n1p2 and nvme0n1p3, and then expand my Arch partition (nvme0n1p4) to the unallocated space.
 Is this possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, everyone. Here is the problem: 
 my arch linux terminal (alacritty and st) can't render the correct nert font icon, but it works on the mac alacritty with the same config and font(Hack Nerd Font Mono). Also i use dwm as my window manager. Here is the images: mac alacritty and arch alacritty
 I am not sure it is caused by arch or dwm or something else, but it troubles me, so i ask it here and hope to solve this.
 And Thanks guys.

Tutti i PC e i server che già montino una release precedente sono aggiornabili direttamente, senza che sia necessario formattare, reinstallare da zero o perdere i propri dati. Questa guida mostra dunque come aggiornare a Ubuntu 22.04 LTS tramite linea di comando. La procedura funziona sia con Ubuntu Desktop (l'edizione dotata di interfaccia grafica e rivolta ai PC) sia su Ubuntu Server. È stata testata partendo sia da Ubuntu 21.10 (la versione immediatamente precedente), sia da Ubuntu 20.04 (la versione LTS del 2020), ma è compatibile con qualsiasi generazione. Procediamo!

So I tested several other distros and I'm currently running debian, but the stable version of debian has outdated packages as hell, this is so remarkable that I couldn't even run pipewire correctly on bullseye.

 in the /etc/pulse/daemon.conf.
 I have two flac files (format told by ffmpeg -i): - Audio: flac, 44100 Hz, stereo, s16 - Audio: flac, 96000 Hz, stereo, s32 (24 bit)
 When I have default-sample-rate = 44100 the first one is played with resample-method = (null) and not the second one (the second one uses the above-mentioned resample method).
 When I have default-sample-rate = 96000 the second one is played with resample-method = (null) and not the first one. Alternate sample rate is ignored.
 (this has been acquired using pacmd list-sink-inputs)
 Question.
 Please, how to config Pulseaudio to allow avoiding resampling for multiple sample rates simultaneously?
 Config. - current stable Arch - not using pipewire-pulse just plain pulseaudio - using external USB DAC capable of 32bit/192kHz - alsa_output.usb-Schiit_Audio_I_m_Fulla_Schiit-00.iec958-stereo/#0: I'm Fulla Schiit Digital Stereo (IEC958)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes, when an app has outlived its usefulness, you’ll want to uninstall it to make way for new ones. Uninstalling apps is easy enough: simply go to the Apps list, find the app, and hit the Uninstall button. But it’s not so easy to completely uninstall apps on Android.
    
Unfortunately, for those who like a clean file system, some apps will leave behind “orphaned files” after uninstallation on Android devices. These files were created by the app so that it can do its job if they weren’t properly deleted after the app was uninstalled. This can get annoying when your device’s system is slowly clogged up by files and folders that aren’t being used. The solution then is to find a way to reliably remove leftover app data.

Hey all, I use musicbee as a music player on windows, and I've found it really convenient to be able to use the exact library files for it on both linux and windows on my dual-booted desktop. The only real problem I'm having (- other than non-latin characters not showing up correctly) is that I'm not able to make any edits to files within musicbee as every time I try to eg, like a song, export a playlist etc, I get the error 'Sharing violation. This file cannot be updated as another application has this file open at the same time'. 
 Checking fuser on the files in question show that they are used by 'MusicBee.exe' and 'wineserver', probably meaning that wineserver is what's causing musicbee to lock up on making these edits. Anyone know of a fix for this?
  
Only, the music is on my Linux Mint, ext4 drive, so I'm not sure what is happening. The comments mention this might be a permissions issue, but I don't have enough linux knowledge to be able to follow the comments or otherwise figure out how to resolve this error.
 Any ideas?
 EDIT: Was able to figure out how to get CJK fonts installed (mostly) using Winetricks, but the sharing violation issue still persists.

 I know I can remove the meta-packages (and that's what I started to do) , but I thought that new packages might be added and i would like to learn about them.
 So i can either (1) use some tool to watch and notify me of new dependencies on the meta-packages; or i can (2) keep the metapackages, remove the unneded dependencies and prevent their auto-reinstallation with some tool; or i can (3) remove the metapackages and only keep the ones i want to, using some other tool to monitor for new dependencies on the meta-packages.
 Has anyone used something to do what i want to do?
 EDIT: I've already seen about IgnorePackage and i've red that it only prevents upgrading a package once it's installed, but does not prevent automatic reinstallation of dependency. I have not tried it personally.
 I've also heard about creating a dummy package to lie to the OS, but my gut feeling does not like that.
 EDIT 2: Maybe it'll be best for me to make my own tool to fetch/check for new packages in kde-* groups and possibly use groups.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have Win11 and Ubuntu installed on 2 different drives already and booting with GRUB. I've been using Ubuntu for a while for school and would like to keep it instead of completely replacing it with Arch. But I'm going to start an internship in a couple months and they use Arch. Any tips on how to install Arch on a 3rd ssd and continue to use GRUB? Anything I should know beforehand that could cause problems? 
 edit: Thanks for the replies. Look's like I was overthinking things and it should be pretty straight-forward. Thanks for the help!
