        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After quite a long evening, we finally managed to package the new nvidia-open drivers. They are now in [testing] and I'd like for some extra opinions with these drivers as they are quite experimental. I packaged them to the best of my knowledge but again, they might be unusable for most purposes. Those with compatible hardware (fairly recent hardware) can install the package and give it a spin. Keep in mind that they are at the moment severely limited as opposed to the blob drivers.
 Take special note of the post install note:
  
In order to boot this on non-datacenter cards, you currently need to set NVreg_OpenRmEnableUnsupportedGpus=1 during module load You can try it like this: modprobe nvidia NVreg_OpenRmEnableUnsupportedGpus=1 but you should likely set it in a /etc/modprobe.d file to make it permanent.
  
I'd like to collect some feedback directly in this thread.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even if you absolutely love Android, sometimes iOS adds a feature you would love to have, such as extra security features. Since iOS 14, there is an alert feature in the form of a small dot that lets users know whenever apps are using the microphone or camera. You don’t have to switch to an iPhone, though. Android users just need the free app Access Dots for similar security alerts on Android 12.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GDM redirects stdout and stderr for processes launched in a session to the systemd journal. When starting an alternative (i.e. not Gnome) session from GDM (in my case, awesomewm) all of the journal entries show as logged from `gdm-x-session. When running Gnome, the entries are correctly attributed to their application.
 How can I ensure that the correct originating application is passed through to the journal when not running Gnome?
 Edit: Yes, I realize that this isn't necessarily Arch specific; however, it's not clear where else I could conceivably ask. r/gnome is likely to go down the rabbit hole of, "Why would you use gdm if you're not using Gnome?" which isn't going to get me anywhere.

Occorre premettere che ogni uscita di Linux Mint porta con sé una serie di sfondi del desktop particolarmente accattivanti e affascinanti, ma soltanto delle edizioni più recenti, ossia abbandonando i background delle versioni più datate, succedutesi nel tempo. Con questo articolo vedremo invece come "recuperare" i background di alcune "vecchie" edizioni di Linux Mint, Tara e Tessa in particolare.

The sound works fine until I see my cursor loading something and stops. I've come to realize I can extend how long it takes for it to stop working by immediately starting a task that uses sound at startup, like spotify, but as soon as it is closed, the sound deactivates.
 Also, while the sound doesn't work, neither does music playback on spotify (music fails to load at all), nor does youtube video playback.
 Anybody know anything about this bizarre issue?

 Hello, so today I've ran into an issue where as the title says, I am not able to get videos on youtube loaded. I'm getting infinite loading circle and after a while text saying "If the video doesn't load shortly, try restarting your device". appears
 I've tried following browsers:
 Firefox (+ private browsing without addons)
 Brave
 Falcon
 LibreWolf
 ​
 This started happening today. Win10 works fine. I've updated my system yesterday. Could that be the cause? Anyone got the same problem? Thanks!
 ​
 EDIT2: Netflix and probably all other similiar websites won't work

Il nome utente e la password sono dati insufficienti a garantire elevati standard di sicurezza perché sono facili da sottrarre e possono essere utilizzati da soggetti non autorizzati. Ne abbiamo parlato anche in occasione del World Password Day.Molte applicazioni online chiedono oggi agli utenti di aggiungere un ulteriore livello di sicurezza al proprio account e lo fanno abilitando l'autenticazione a due fattori o 2FA (two factor authentication).Abbiamo visto cos'è l'autenticazione a due fattori e sappiamo che esistono vari metodi per implementarla e utilizzarla, alcuni molto più di sicuri di altri. Ad esempio gli SMS sono meno sicuri nell'ambito di un sistema per l'autenticazione a due fattori: la crescita vorticosa del numero di attacchi SIM swap ne è la conferma.
Codici OTP: cosa sono
 Acronimo di One-time password, gli OTP sono codici che vengono generati sul dispositivo dell'utente e che sono validi, in combinazione con altri fattori (ad esempio username e password), per autenticarsi e ottenere l'accesso a un sito Web o un servizio online.Sono anche comunemente utilizzati per apporre la firma digitale remota, utile per sottoscrivere documenti digitali così come se vi si fosse applicata la propria firma autografa.Gli OTP sono anche conosciuti come 'password usa e getta' perché restano validi per breve tempo e in ogni caso solo per una singola sessione di accesso o una specifica transazione.I codici OTP vengono generati da parte di apposite app di autenticazione installabili e avviabili su un dispositivo mobile o su un computer.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sed is a simple UNIX program. It does not create and edit files. It only modifies the data that passes through its input and presents the modified data on its output. Despite that, sed is considered to be one of the most powerful UNIX utilities that you will encounter in Linux, especially when it is combined with other programs in your system.
    
This article aims to teach the basics of how to use this tiny program. Further, it will also give a brief overview of the UNIX philosophy and how that idea is important in understanding how your computer works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After powering on the machine this morning all seemed normal, when changing volume settings the normal pop sound effect was heard. Launched a RPGXP game using Wine. The game functioned perfectly yesterday and today I noticed missing music but some sound effects remained working. I did some trouble shooting thinking the files were gone but when I attempted to play them in vlc there was nothing. I now no longer heard the popping from changing volume and all audio was gone. Running soundest on any audio device gave no results. From here I noticed YouTube videos are forever loading and no audio at all out of anything on all outputs tried. Using KDE Plasma as the DE and attempted reinstalling of pulse and Alsa with no success.Still pretty new to Arch and Linux in general so any info that may be needed please let me know and I will post. Thanks for any help!
 ​
 EDIT: Rebooted system again after this post and all is fixed. Not a single clue what went wrong, what broke what. No idea why this reboot worked but the previous 4 did not. If anyone still has insight it is appreciated but the problem is seemingly gone at this time.
 EDIT AGAIN: The problem is back so no real solution has been found. Have not a clue what could be causing it. If there is any ideas out there the help is much appreciated

Quegli stessi soggetti che si cerca di tutelare.Oggi la Commissione Europea ha annunciato un'ulteriore nuova regolamentazione che mira a proteggere i minori dagli abusi.Anche in questo caso le finalità sono nobili ma le conseguenze degli adempimenti di cui si parla potrebbero rivelarsi estremamente invasivi e pericolosissimi sul piano della tutela della privacy.Stando a quanto proposto in sede europea, le applicazioni di messaggistica istantanea, comprese WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Signal e così via, saranno chiamate ad analizzare selettivamente i messaggi privati degli utenti alla ricerca di materiale pedopornografico e di comportamenti equiparabili ad attività di 'adescamento' di soggetti minorenni.Matthew Green, uno dei più noti e stimati docenti di crittografia, ha condannato senza appello la scelta europea definendo il documento presentato come 'il più terrificante mai visto finora.]]></summary>

Potrebbe essere una buona idea per risparmiare energia, ridurre i consumi energetici ed evitare di sottoporre i componenti hardware a un inutile stress.Abbiamo visto che le opzioni per il risparmio di energia che Windows mette a disposizione consentono di disporre la disattivazione dello schermo e la sospensione del computer.Per accedere rapidamente a queste impostazioni basta premere Windows+R quindi digitare powercfg.cpl: cliccando su Specifica impostazioni di disattivazione dello schermo oppure su Modifica impostazione di sospensione del computer si può decidere dopo quanti minuti disattivare lo schermo o porre in sospensione il PC.

Per impostazione predefinita Windows non prevede la possibilità di spegnere o ibernare automaticamente il PC dopo un certo periodo di tempo ovvero trascorsi alcuni minuti di completo inutilizzo.Rispetto alla sospensione, l'ibernazione consente di spegnere (quasi) del tutto il computer pur avendo la possibilità di riprendere poi il lavoro dove lo si era lasciato.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple ha deciso di 'staccare la spina' a uno dei dispositivi che hanno fatto la storia dell'azienda. A distanza di 15 anni dalla sua nascita, la Mela interrompe la produzione dell'iPod Touch escludendo dal suo catalogo il rivoluzionario riproduttore musicale.L'annuncio non specifica esattamente quando iPod Touch, giunto nel frattempo alla sua settima generazione, verrà ritirato. Apple si è limitata a dire che il dispositivo sarà disponibile per l'acquisto soltanto fino ad esaurimento scorte: terminate le scorte di magazzino finirà anche il ciclo di vita dell'iPod Touch.Molto più di un semplice lettore musicale, iPod Touch può essere utilizzato come dispositivo di gioco portatile o come fotocamera digitale (da 8 Megapixel) ed è anche in grado di connettersi a Internet tramite WiFi. Piccolo e leggero con un jack cuffia non riceve telefonate e può essere utilizzato per ascoltare audiolibri o leggere e-book.Il modello più recente, presentato a maggio 2019, è l'unico rimasto in vita dopo l'abbandono dell'iPod Nano e dell'iPod Shuffle nel luglio 2017.Utilizza un chip A10 Fusion relativamente potente abbinato a un display Retina da 4 pollici e fino a 256 GB di memoria.Sebbene i lettori musicali portatili rappresentino oggi un mercato molto di nicchia, dato che gli smartphone fanno davvero tutto coprendo tutte le esigenze, ci sono alcune categorie di utenti che comunque sentiranno la mancanza dell'iPod.Apple non è un'azienda che fornisce troppe spiegazioni sulle decisioni strategiche riguardanti i suoi prodotti e servizi ma molto probabilmente l'accantonamento di iPod Touch ha a che fare con il contenuto numero di esemplari venduti e con lo stress che sta subendo l'intera catena produttiva (leggasi: meglio convergere le risorse su altri prodotti).Con l'addio all'iPod Touch, che attualmente supporta l'ultima versione di iOS disponibile, iOS 15, si chiude un'epoca.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just did an update this morning and rebooted. I saw something about wireplumber during the update and I think this may have been the cause.
 So basically, none of my music is playable and none of the videos I have are working. Also, I'm getting mo audio from YouTube, Odysee or any other video or audio source on the web. Not even RPAN is working. I've tried rebooting but this is not working either. I think the update broke my audio... This is frustrating!
 SOLVED:
 The fix I found said to comment out this line in /etc/pulse/default.pa
 #load-module module-suspend-on-idle
 Then reboot.
 I did this and now I have audio again without having to downgrade any packages.

 One of the negative points towards Windows that makes me very angry is the fact that it is constantly updating and needing to be restarted. I switched to Linux also to overcome this need, however, I notice that it is also recommended to constantly update in Arch Linux, so finally the user experience in this regard is more or less the same.
 I believe there are other distros without this need, but I am really enjoying using Arch and learning from it and from this community.
 tldr; What is your opinion about the recommended updates in Arch, any advice to keep the system sort of up-to-date but without the need to update every now and then? Thanks!

 The wiki says you can just use single backslash to escape.How many backslash I use, it doesn't work.
 I've tried editing the cmdline directly in grub menu. I've tried using /dev/disk/by-id.

 I can't get my emoji font setup working properly. When noto-fonts-emoji is installed, most things work. Except MS Teams (in a browser), which becomes unreadable, because every space character has the width of an emoji.
 When I uninstall noto-fonts-emoji this is fixed, but of course, now I have no Emoji support.
 How can I get this sorted out?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having an issue where after starting Firefox, I lose sound output system-wide on all devices and pulseaudio spits out this continuously in journald when attempting audio playback:
 2022-05-10 8:39 P.M. pulseaudio Failed to create sink input: sink is suspended. 
 I tried clearing my home dir of all pulse files/configs. Kernel rollback doesn't help, and there doesn't seem to be an easy way to get rid of wireplumber for pipewire-session-manager as the latter has replaced the former on official repos and is now a dependency for kwin.
 The initial upgrade made the following symlinks in the pacman log:
 [2022-05-10T17:19:36-0400] [ALPM] installed wireplumber (0.4.10-2) [2022-05-10T17:19:36-0400] [ALPM-SCRIPTLET] Created symlink /etc/systemd/user/pipewire-session-manager.service → /usr/lib/systemd/user/wireplumber.service. [2022-05-10T17:19:36-0400] [ALPM-SCRIPTLET] Created symlink /etc/systemd/user/pipewire.service.wants/wireplumber.service → /usr/lib/systemd/user/wireplumber.service. 
 If I never run Firefox, my audio seems to work fine. Rebooting restores audio functionality, whereas logging out/in as another user in plasma via sddm does not. Any one else hit by this today?

Perhaps you’re signing a contract or adding a professional flair to a letter. If you’re printing the document, it’s a simple case of signing after it’s printed. Of course, things are a little trickier if you want to email the document or print lots of copies of the same document.
    
Fortunately, if you do find yourself in a position where you need a signature on a Google Doc and want something a little more professional than just typing your name, there are a few ways you can add one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for a quality set of earbuds and don’t like the Apple AirPods? Perhaps you need to try the Powerbeats Pro Wireless Earbuds. They have the Apple H1 headphone chip and provide nine hours of listening time. Act now, and you’ll save $70.
    
The earbuds have an adjustable, secure, stable fit with ear hooks yet remain lightweight and comfortable. They have a reinforced design to make them sweat- and water-resistant for the times you’re caught in the rain while out for a run or sweat through a tough workout.
    

    
The Powerbeats Pro Wireless Earbuds include the Apple H1 headphone chip and Class 1 Bluetooth to ensure fewer dropouts while bringing an extended range. Despite having the Apple chip, the earbuds are compatible with both iPhones and Android. Either earbud provides enhanced phone call performance.
    
While a single charge of the earbuds provides up to nine hours of listening time, you can stretch that to 24 hours with the charging case. A five-minute charge will give you 1.5 hours... Read more]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[the touchpad of my laptop has a very strange behaviour and i cant figure out how to fix it. basically the touchpad works completely for weeks at a time, but then for a few days it becomes unusable.
  
it works for a few seconds normally, but then does not respond to any input at all for a few minutes. this cycle repeats many many times.
 othertimes the cursor becomes 'stuck' in place until i click down on the touchpad and drag at the same time, then the cursor moves. and while im in this 'stuck' mode i can scroll by moving 1 finger up and down on the touchpad.
 it works normally on the lockscreen and for about 30 seconds after rebooting, but eventually it stops working again.
  
the touchpad is recognised according to 'xinput list': 'SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad id=16 [slave pointer (2)]' the only way i have found to 'fix' the touchpad from the not working state is to do 'modprobe -r psmouse' and then 'modprobe psmouse'. this guarantees it to work for a few seconds before immediately not working again. and during the few seconds it works, i cant do finger scrolling or touch actions, only tracking and clicking. my laptop is a hp spectre x360 convertible and im using updated arch linux. but i have also experienced this behaviour on other distros and kernels.
 the weirdest part is that these bugged behaviours will completely fix themselves after a few days, and i have no idea why. this 'schedule' has happened to me multiple times before but i want to fix it for good now, it is very annoying. any help is appreciated.

Yesterday I worked fine all day, and at the end of the day I ran yay -Syu to fully update my system. After that I turned of the computer
 Today I booted it up again and it starts with limited connectivity and I don't know how to fix it.
 Ran nmcli general command and everything shows green and connected, except for "connectivity" which is written "limited" in yellow.
 I'm running Arch with the Kernel 5.17.5-arch1-1 Gnome is on version 42.1
 I am plugged to the Ethernet cable and my computer doesn't have wifi
