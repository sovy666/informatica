        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had to drop back to Fedora this past week because I can't connect my preferred Bluetooth headphones under Arch (an MPOW BH408 receiver that I'm using while I wait for a new headset). I get the following error in bluetoothctl in which it appears to try connecting three times in rapid succession and then give up:
  Agent registered [bluetooth]# devices Device E3:28:E9:24:30:BA MPOW BH408 Device 20:19:09:37:F6:D9 U8I [bluetooth]# connect E3:28:E9:24:30:BA Attempting to connect to E3:28:E9:24:30:BA [CHG] Device E3:28:E9:24:30:BA Connected: yes Failed to connect: org.bluez.Error.Failed br-connection-canceled [CHG] Device E3:28:E9:24:30:BA Connected: no [CHG] Device E3:28:E9:24:30:BA Connected: yes [CHG] Device E3:28:E9:24:30:BA Connected: no [CHG] Device E3:28:E9:24:30:BA Connected: yes [CHG] Device E3:28:E9:24:30:BA Connected: no [bluetooth]# quit 
 What's weird is that the other device listed in bluetoothctl (my backup headset) connects without an issue (just bad sound as per the usual with this model), so it appears to be related to the particular combination of the version of Bluez and the MPOW BH408. It works under the slightly older version of Bluez currently used by Fedora 35. Any idea of how I can diagnose this? Not really a big deal as my new headset arrives Monday and I can put up with poor sound quality using my backup headset for a couple days.

I have tried countless times to resolve "bootctl --path=/boot, install exit with code [256]: b'File system "/boot" is not a FAT EFI System Partition (ESP) file system.". I have partitioned and flagged my nvme drive either through this script (doesn't flag), fdisk, gdisk, and gparted without a resolution. I have partitioned /boot with all the filesystem formats but same error. I'm certain the auto partitioning scheme works perfectly well however boot and root auot partitioned sizes are to small for my 1tb preferences. Anything I maybe missing or doing wrong is greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I was normally browsing Firefox when at some point some tabs stopped working randomly. I thought nothing of it and just closed firefox but then it would not start again, just as any other graphical app I try to open (Brave, VS Code and others). The error that firefox is giving me is:
 XPCOMGlueLoad error: error for file /usr/lib/firefox/libmozgtk.so libicuuc.so.71: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Couldn't load XPCOM
 VS Code gives me this error:
 /opt/visual-studio-code/bin/../code: error while loading shared libraries: libicuuc.so.71: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
 So yeah, it looks like something screwed up the stuff needed for graphical interfaces, but I did nothing other than update my system (and I see no one else currently complaining about some similar breakage). What should I do?
 EDIT: updated my system after typing this post out, everything now works normally ¯_(ツ)_/¯

I selected cinnamon as the DE and it's working fine, but I would like to try out a couple different DEs, so I installed LightDM. After installing cutefish, LightDM should now offer a selection between cinnamon and cutefish, right? Well, the greeter asks for the password and then boots straight into cinnamon.
 I read all the wiki pages and I still can't get LightDM to offer the choice. I tried modifying the ~/.dmrc file and creating an ~/.xinitrc file, but they only work halfway. Some windows use cutefish, and others, like the taskbar and start menu use cinnamon. Can someone tell me what I'm missing here? Do I need to reinstall without a DE, install LightDM first, and then install any DEs/WMs?
 Here's a screenshot with the files I've made/modified, and the mixed DEs. Sorry for being a noob https://imgur.com/a/2q30lQc

Arch
 Cinnamon with Xorg (i.e. not wayland)
 Nvidia GPU
 Steam/Proton To Launch Game
 Single Monitor
  
Using Proton 6.3.8, I can launch BfV and it works like normal (full screen). If I switch to Proton 7, the game launches fine but just stays minimised in the bottom panel, and whenever I click it, it opens for a split second and minimises again. I've tried running a /etc/env value of export SDL_VIDEO_MINIMIZE_ON_FOCUS_LOSS=0. I've also tried using that variable in the launcher options for the game. If I run the game in 6.3.8 and change it to boarderless full screen, and then run the game in proton 7 it works (although, for whatever reason my menu bar keeps popping up every so often). I don't understand what I actually need to check to try and work out what bit is causing the game to constantly minimise. Where to go from here?

 I have two different laptops with the same arch install (literally, the same, cloned from one to the other). One of them has an nvidia graphics card + integrated and the other one just integrated.
 I noticed that the mouse cursor movement is perfect on the nvidia laptop while it looks like a game missing frames on the Intel.
 There's no problem controlling the pointer, it's not jittery, it doesn't stutter, or anything like that. But its movement is definitely not smooth.
 I ask here because googling didn't bring me any answers and I would expect the mouse movement to be smooth, if all desktop effects are (I've compared window animations and those look the same, to me, on both laptops)
 Any ideas?
 Thanks.

 I get KISS and that Arch doesn't split packages but it would be nice to not have a bunch of stuff I'll never use taking up space in the menus.
 Edit: I know I can just hide the menu entries. I'm pretty sure I can't actually remove them but I'm asking in case I missed something, and kind of just to gripe rhetorically.

        <link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/u4lcnd/gdm_fingerprint_authentication_with_systemdhomed/"/>
        <updated>2022-04-16T00:05:06.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost a year ago I acquired a thinkpad p1 gen 3 from my employer, and of course immediately wiped Windows in favor of Arch with GNOME. As with every install, I wanted to play with what was new in the linux world so I set up my user account using systemd-homed as a BTRFS subvolume (not an encrypted luks loopback). For the most part this has worked out ok. 
 Recently, I wanted to set up the fingerprint reader so I installed and enabled fprint. Theoretically this is supposed to enable the fingerprint enrollement UI inside GNOME settings without further configuration. It did not. I was able to register a print with fprint-enroll and the effects are:
  
fprint-verify works
 GDM prompts that I can use fingerprint to log in, but attempting to do so always fails
 The GNOME lock screen also prompts that I can use fingerprint to unlock, and that works fairly reliably (the sensor itself seems finicky, which squares with what ive read of others' experience with thinkpad fingerprint readers)
 systemd-ask-password prompts (such as when running a systemctl command without sudo, which display via GNOME UI) do not offer fingerprint authentication, nor does it work if i try to press the sensor anyway
 GNOME settings still shows nothing in relation to fingerprint auth in the user management section 
  
I've searched around a bit and I haven't been able to find anything about this issue from other users, so I'm hoping someone around here has some experience with this odd combination of fingerprint auth, GNOME and systemd-homed that can provide some insight.
 Fail that, it's quite difficult to figure out where exactly to open an issue with upstream GNOME or what chat channels are available to work through debugging so maybe some pointers there would be helpful.
 tl;dr fprint + systemd-homed doesn't seem to be picked up by GNOME authentication prompts consistently. Unsure where to seek help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Help me out. What do you call your LVM group? From my perspective I don't see a time where I would ever have more than one group on a computer. I just create multiple volumes/Partitions inside that one group. So it becomes tedious constantly typing a long group name.
 /dev/long group name/volume name
 I have been using "group" as in
 /dev/group/arch
 But I'm thinking of just putting "lvm" or maybe just a single letter "g"
 So I'd get
 /dev/g/arch
 Any problems with that? 
 Follow up question.
 On naming the logical volumes inside my group, can I add descriptive extensions? Can I make a volume named "arch.cutefish" to indicate the desktop installed? 
 So get something like
 /dev/lvm/arch.cutefish

Currently, you can get the Amazon Echo Dot 4th Gen Smart Speaker for under $40. It’s a suitable choice if you’re trying to build a network of speakers around your home, but it also works great as a standalone unit
    
The Dot is Amazon’s most popular smart speaker. It’s compact enough to fit into small spaces in your home, office, and even your camper, just about anywhere you want to hear music with crisp vocals and balanced bass. Place them in multiple rooms to send announcements to the other speakers. It’s a great way to let the family know it’s time for dinner or that you’re running errands and will be back in a few hours.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What happens if a distro that is no longer supported? I understand that using an unsupported distro can cause incompatibility and security issues. ▫️ This is where I have a doubt. I think this is if that distro uses its own repositories, but if it uses the official Arch repositories then it shouldn't be a problem as the system will always be up to date regardless if that distro stops development, as long as it doesn't run his own pre-installed programs (unsupported) should have no problem. Right? ▫️ Example, this can be a problem with distros like Ubuntu but not with Endeavor OS that uses official Arch repositories, as long as they are still online there will be no problem if the Endeavour project comes to an end tomorrow I will not be "forced" to change the OS if I don't want to. ▫️ Am I correct, or is there something I'm not considering? 🤔

 Power consumption
 Before tlp: 8-9W After tlp: 8-9W
 After laptop-mode-tools: 5-6W
 Only default configuration in both tools and with terminal opened and 3 tabs in Firefox 30% brightness, Bluetooth off and Wifi connected system wide dark theme No load
 I've read in articles that both tools does same thing and tlp is more updated and better but for me tlp has no effect.
 I've followed every step given in Arch wiki Installed tlp-rdw as well masked necessary things and enabled daemon But no effect tried restarting also.
 System info
 Asus Zenbook ux325
 16GB Ram 512GB nvme ssd
 Arch Linux Kernel 5.17 With Gnome (Tried sway and kde same drain rate) 
 Window system Wayland
 Graphics enabled
 Answer will be appreciated
 I know 5-6W is already very sufficient
 Just curious if tlp would work I may able to reduce power consumption to 4W maybe 😅

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I just did a fresh install of Arch Linux (plain arch, not arch-based like Manjaro) and so far everything looks like it's working just fine and I got the AUR installed with the Paru AUR helper. 
 Unfortunately I just installed Minecraft Launcher and Prusa Slicer (a 3D printing application) and both of these look like they installed properly, I didn't get any error message of any kind in the terminal, but they don't actually open. When I try to open the desktop icon, they just don't do anything. They don't flash a screen or anything, it's like the icon isn't connected to anything. Minecraft was installed through the AUR and Prusa was installed with regular Pacman. Does anyone know how I might be able to fix this? I kind of have a feeling the desktop shortcuts might be bugged, so if anyone can tell me how I could open an app through the terminal, I could give that a shot and see if it was a bad install or if there's something wrong with the shortcut itself. 
 Thank you in advance!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I installed arch Linux on a laptop with Ly desktop manager and KDE Plasma. Wayland sessions are extremely unstable in my case so I use X11. If I switch to another TTY on a fresh boot without logging into Plasma, I can run systemctl suspend and the laptop sleeps as expected. Once I have Plasma running, systemctl suspend or closing the laptop lid causes the screen to go black but the laptop never enters a suspended state. There is no way that I know to recover the system at this point. Even if I killall plasmashell first, and try to suspend, the problem persists. Plasma power management settings are configured appropriately, so it’s not that simple. Anyone have any tips?
