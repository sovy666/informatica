        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am working on a project that uses .net for the back-end. I noticed that the dot-net package has been flagged out of date for a few months now, so I don't feel too comfortable testing it out. Does anyone have any experience developing .net on arch and is there any problem with it? Thanks.

So my issue is that the open source drivers dont connect to my gpu. my plymouth doesnt load, and neither does gdm. i have the modules in my initramfs. They seem to be behaving as though there is no nvidia gpu in my system. i have an rtx 2060. how can i get the drivers to work with my gpu?

I type the command in like "ssh -p 8000 [me@myserver.org](mailto:me@myserver.org)" and it does nothing and looks like it's just waiting there forever, I've waited up to 30 minutes several times just to see if it would do anything but it doesn't and I end up having to use ctrl+c on it. If I disconnect from my network and try it again it instantly says "ssh: connect to host 0.0.27.84 port 22: Network is unreachable" which is not even close to the address or port that I entered. I currently dual boot and it works in windows. I've searched everywhere and haven't found any similar issues so if anyone could help or point me in the right direction, it would be very much appreciated.

 To change the install script would I have to rebuild the iso or is it possible to do it directly on the USB?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am posting this because I could not find the solution on Google OR the arch wiki.
 This was a super annoying bug.
 Here are easy steps to fix this.
  
Install gnome-disk-utility - sudo pacman -S gnome-disk-utility
 Install ntfs-3g - sudo pacman -S ntfs-3g
 Open gnome-disk-utility
 Select the device you would like to mount
 Select the partition you would like to mount
 There should be either a gear or triangle inside a square. Click on it. (https://i.imgur.com/gBAdsUJ.png if you need to be sure what to click)
 You should get a menu. Click "Edit Mount Options"
 Turn off user session defaults
 Make sure that "Mount at system startup" is checked/highlighted
 You can change the mount point if you want. Default is 100% fine, though.
 Click ok and enter your password
 Restart and it should now mount by default

 I have decided to take the easy way out for now and use the 'archinstall' script for installing arch on my external USB SSD, I was wondering if anyone had any strong recommendations of what extra packages to install when asked with the script - so far I'm thinking definitely nano and firefox. Will be installing with Gnome and X11.
 As a side note I would like to use timeshift when setup for all the mistakes I will probably make early on, should I make a small partition on the USB SSD to save that into and if so what filesystem should it be and approx size? I am currently using an older Samsung 256GB EVO from an old build in an enclosure.
 Thanks in advance!

 OBS Studio works fine but for some reason rpan studio isn't doing that.
 The program runs fine. I just can't get it to show up in the menu.
 I've thought about using an older version but I doubt that will change anything. 
 I'm using Arch Linux with the Cinnamon desktop. Should I try KDE plasma instead?
 System specs are ThinkServer TS140. It's pretty fast with 16gb of ram. 5tb hdd for the /home and the rest is on a 1tb ssd. This system is super fast! 
 I don't know why it isn't working.

I was given a grub boot error. Of an unexpected end of vmlinuz file. I tried rebuilding my mkinitcpio, but that gave me an error of the linux file being incomplete or empty. I then restored from prior backup, and tried updating again. Which led to the same error in grub. I have looked around, and haven’t been able to find any solutions. Any ideas?

So I cannot update with pacman, because then my openjpeg2 would get updated to 2.5.0, which breaks the lib32-openjpeg2 dependency on it being only 2.4.0, and I cannot update lib32-openjpeg2 from AUR (using yay) because it wants to update openjpeg2 from repos before and it fails the same.
 So, what's the way out of this?
  
EDIT: Solved using the --nodeps (-Sd) option.

 If I understood right how the AUR works, a dangerous package is one that is not very downloaded and ... that's about it. I think/hope there is moderation done on the AUR packages so the major part of dangerous packages are deleted very early.
 So correct me if I'm wrong but there very few packages out there that are really dangerous for my system ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 A few days ago, I had a weird Bluetooth headset crash, audio stopped and the headset acted like it was connected and turned off at the same time. As I already had this kind of situations, I disabled Bluetooth, turned it back on and reconnected the headset. But this time, upon reconnecting, I had no sound coming out from it.
 The only sound I am able to hear are the notification sounds from GNOME. That's it.
 I tested a BT speaker, a wired headset and even the internal speakers wouldn't work at all, which is very annoying because I use this laptop mostly for entertainment.
 I started running some tests : 
 The laptop speakers do work properly. I tested under Windows 10 (the laptop dual boots) and the speakers and BT speakers do work properly.
 I tried to make it forget the headset that had the crash and pairing it back to no avail.
 speaker-test (from alsa-utils) didn't work so I guess there's the issue ?
 EasyEffects seem to detect audio from apps (I tested with Firefox, Audacious and VLC) but no sound waves are displayed, indicating that the issue must be before PipeWire in the audio software stack. In the case of Audacious, it's internal sound wave display works, indicating that audio is being decoded by the app.
 No, the sound was not muted and the correct output was chosen in the settings. That's the first things I've checked.
 I'm pretty sure the issue lies within ALSA but how can it be persistent after reboot if it was a crash ? Is there a way to put it back to default settings ?
 I'm running pretty much the same audio software stack on my main desktop and I regularly use BT speakers with it and I hadn't encountered this issue (it runs on KDE but that shouldn't affect audio as far as I'm aware of).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been having an issue where pacman is installing to my root partition that is only 30GB so installing things like the cudnn package is filling up my entire drive along with other things that I have only just realized are doing that. I have been looking for a way to make it so that pacman installs in my main LVM partition, but have found that nothing on the wiki that says I can even do that. So with this in mind, my question is this: Is there a way to change where pacman installs so that it's not in my root partition or will I have to reinstall and give my root partition more space keeping in mind the packages I want to install?
 ​
 I have done my best to RTFM for pacman and the closest thing I have found is a reddit post suggesting it would be possible to change the pacman package installation directory. This would be to create a hook which I am assuming means if it hits this directory redirect it to another one. Though I don't know enough to know if this is good solution or something that would bite me later.

 modern desktop systems quite often have 64GB of ram or more available. but the efly live system (repo here) had a very conservative restriction of just 256MB for the copy-on-write virtual file system.
 the arch wiki describes a solution. but this solution is manual. and you need to know that it's possible, where to find it and how it works.
 in other words not very practical. so i've been playing around a bit and wrote a script, that runs at boot and adjusts the virtual file system limit (cowspace) according to your available RAM.
