        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, i am still fairly new to linux but i want to get into Arch after using Ubuntu and Tails for a while. My problem is that whenever I am to try and select the option to boot into install medium, the screen will go black for ~10 seconds and then it will just reboot back to where it was. I tried using DD, i am using UEFI and GBR, and secure boot is disabled. I also know there is no issue with the USB because it will boot into the installer on my other pc just fine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of all, let me explain how I got here: 
 When installing arch, I used the archinstall utility and when asked about partitioning I selected "Best effort partition layout", which lead the utility to create two partitions (apart from boot and efi): "Filesystem Root" and "Home". Home contains just my home folder and Filesystem Root contains everything else. After using arch for about 3 months (where I am now) the Filesystem Root has filled up, so I tried merging the two partitions: 
 First I made a live usb with EndeavourOS (I picked this distro at random, but I don't think it matters) and booted off of it, then I resized the Home partition to be 80GB instead of 150GB and resized the Root partition to be 100GB instead of 35GB. 
 After a reboot to check if I didn't screw up already (everything was fine) I went to the live usb again and copied my user home folder to the root partition, after this I rebooted: 
 Where I am now
 ​
 I can't login into my user (gnome 42.1 with gdm) when using Xorg, but when using Wayland I can login and find that almost no apps open (I think I broke flatpak apps) and when launching apps from terminal they say Authorization required, but no authorization protocol specified. 
 I am stuck at this strange error message now, although I have a backup of the home folder since I copied it instead of moving it. 
 Sorry for any english mistakes, it's not my primary language. If I have left any important information just ask in the comments and I will provide it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Someone recently asked whether the Zen-kernel is still viable for gaming and I was wondering the same thing. After doing a little research I found no recent comparison between the popular kernels for gaming on Arch Linux: linux-zen, linux-xanmod and linux-tkg.
 So I figured I should do my own benchmarks and compare those kernels and I asked you guys, which games you wanted to see benchmarked.
 I came up with the following games for various reasons:
  
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
 Civilization VI
 Grand Theft Auto 5
 Cyberpunk 2077
 Shadow of the Tomb Raider
  
These games offer CPU- and GPU-bound scenarios, are more or less popular or often used for benchmarks in the past and they also offer an in-game benchmark.
 Well, when it got to the actual benchmarks, I had to realize, that GTA …]]></summary>

After just reviewing the yeedi vac max Robot Vacuum, I had the chance to review the yeedi vac 2 pro Robot Vacuum, giving me great perspective to examine the new, updated features. I also had the chance to review the optional yeedi self-empty station.

Setting Up the yeedi vac 2 pro and self-empty station
    
While many newer robot vacuums now include self-empty stations, yeedi has chosen to make it optional. I see this as a plus. Not everyone wants this feature, nor do they want to pay the extra to have it. yeedi leaves the option up to the consumer. Additionally, it really doesn’t add that much extra setup.
    

    
The yeedi vac 2 pro ships with:

In termini di gravità, entrambe sono valutate con un punteggio di 9,8 su un massimo di 10 e possono essere sfruttate per aggredire reti aziendali, attivare backdoor, botnet e altre forme di malware.Il 6 aprile scorso VMware ha rivelato e corretto una vulnerabilità legata all'esecuzione di codice in modalità remota (CVE-2022-22954) e un bug che può facilitare l'acquisizione di privilegi più elevati (CVE-2022-22960).Stando a quanto conferma CISA, gli aggressori sono stati in grado di effettuare il reverse engineering delle patch ufficiali VMware in sole 48 ore iniziando rapidamente a sfruttare le vulnerabilità.Secondo i report condivisi da alcune tra le principali aziende che offrono strumenti per la sicurezza informatica, gli attaccanti sono in grado di concatenare le vulnerabilità di VMware per causare danni e sottrarre dati riservati.Nel caso di un'azienda attaccata intorno a metà aprile con un'iniziativa mirata, gli utenti malintenzionati hanno prima sfruttato CVE-2022-22954 per eseguire un comando shell arbitrario come utente VMware.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've bought a brand new Dell XPS 15 9520 laptop (should be a 2022 model). My usual Linux setup involves enabling secure boot with custom keys, and using full-disk encryption with automatic unlock based on TPM. Since the laptop came with Windows preinstalled, it came with secure boot enabled and with Microsoft's keys installed.
 The first thing I tried was putting the UEFI in "Expert Key Management" mode to clear the current keys and allow me to enroll my own, but I was greeted with the below warning:
  
Modifying Secure Boot Databases could renter your system unable to boot. System graphics may not function. Some devices might not function properly. The system could become unrecoverable.
  
This is in the same lines to the warning in the Arch Wiki. I've also read similar reports in the past from people around Reddit. It's also not very clear on just what exactly it means by "may not function". Note that the laptop comes with an integrated intel video card and a dedicated nvidia one.
 Does anybody have experience in enrolling custom keys in their recent Dell laptops? I had no trouble at all enrolling custom keys into my 3-years old Dell Precision 5540, but that laptop had an obviously older UEFI app and a different general build.
 I don't dare to clear the current keys until I find confirmation online that it's safe to do so (I wish Dell included a clearer message).
 ​
 EDIT: here are some pictures on what the UEFI screen shows exactly. Note the warnings in the "Enable Microsoft UEFI CA" section as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, I'm running an M1 Macbook for work, and sadly it's the 13" which is limited to 1 external display (cable connection), though I can connect more displays through airplay. I'm running my peripherals through software KVM and toggle my main screen input through a script.
 Was wondering if someone could recommend a server for running airplay screens on my desktop machine, Ideally something cross-platform as I boot Windows quite often too but platform specific would work too.
 Also, if this supported multiple instances so I could have 2 airplay displays on my desktop machine it would be great.
 Sorry if this is the wrong sub for this, I know this seems to have nothing to do with arch but I thought about going into r/opensource or r/linux but both seem way more dedicated to news than questions, also r/apple or mac or whatever doesn't seem to be a place where people even have this kind of use case.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So while doing some testing a few days ago I had an idea, not sure if something like this exists but I reckon it could be super handy.
 Basically my idea is being able to tag installed packages with labels so you can do things like mass removals easier. For example something like:
 pacman -S [packages] -t (for tag) [tag/label] 
 So, if you wanted to remove that group of packages you could just do something like:
 pacman -R [tag/label used from the install] 
 I know you can use pacman to autoremove packages + their dependencies but it isn't uncommon for me to have to specify apps to remove that depend on something, being able to tag all of those packages and then remove them all at once if needed would be pretty useful IMO.
 I think a good example would be if you wanted to install a desktop environment plus a bunch of other extras on top, but tag them all so if you wanna remove the whole DE + those extras you could a bit easier.
 Just interested to see what people think of something like this.

 As the title says I want to know what it takes to become an Arch Repo Maintainer ?
 I have searched online but not much information so I will ask some questions , maybe someone will answer.
 I want to know for example :
  
How do you look for updates/releases for each package? is this something automated or is a manual job?
 How many hours do you spend to update your repos?
 How hard is to find mirrors to host the packages ? How do you apply for a mirror ? How mirrors are synchronized ?
 How do you assign which one is responsible for each package in order to maintain it?
 How do you trust someone to become a Maintainer? Do you have some criteria ?
 What do you do when a main app is not package for Arch Linux?
 How do you keep up with the Kernel updates and how you maintain it.
 How boring or exciting is this job to do?
 What are the struggles?
 How you keep up with everyday getting alerts that this package is out of date?
  
​
 In short I would like a documentary of a daily life of an Arch Repo Maintainer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I am a long time (since the very early days of Linux kernel) Linux user and developer, who has been mainly a RedHat / Fedora user. Now I decided to give the Arch distribution a go, using the ready made GUI installer variants, and installed it on my new Dell XPS 12900HK system. I didn't invest much time yet but I am seeing that the core frequencies are stuck around 1.5 GHz, even though I max them out via cpupower, set the governor to performance and thermal profile also to Performance. PLs are also looking OK and /sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl:0/constraint_0/1_power_limit_uw are set to 75W and 115W. I use the s-tui stress test and it is stuck at around 1.5 GHz. The temps are below 50°C and the fans are inaudible, so there is no thermal throttling.
 I have no such problems with Fedora, so I was wondering if Arch (or the GUI variant I am using) by default does some tweaking that limits the CPUs for laptops? Does the pure Arch have such (maybe kernel) tweaks? Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In older versions of Windows, you were forced to reinstall the entire operating system if you wanted to convert legacy BIOS or Master Boot Record (MBR) to UEFI or GUID Partition Table (GPT). However, a new and simple tool called MBR2GPT was introduced in Windows 10. It lets you convert legacy BIOS to UEFI with just two commands. 
    
Here is how you can convert legacy BIOS to UEFI in Windows 10. If you’re a Windows 11 user, you shouldn’t do anything, as UEFI mode is enabled by default on your device.
    
Do not skip any of the prerequisites of legacy BIOS to UEFI conversion mentioned below, as it can lead to system failure and even hardware issues in some cases.

 Recently I tried installing python-validity package using yay and every time I try it the build fails because of an error returned by meson.build:
 fprintd-clients/meson.build:1:0: ERROR: Unknown linker(s): [['gcc-ar'], ['ar'], ['gar']] The following exception(s) were encountered: Running "gar --version" gave "[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'gar'" 
 Since it's the second package I encounter this error with (don't remember which one was the first one, though) I thought it hasn't something to do with the package itself but maybe with something on my PC, am I right? Is there something I can do to fix this?
 (I already tried uninstalling meson and reinstalling it first using pip and then using yay... it seems to be installed successfully, but I don't know)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have been having some confusing problems with my wifi.
 Network manager is often, but not always, unable to see any WiFi networks and there appears to be a correlation with this problem and the wifi networks my university provides, specifically eduroam. Occasionally I will be able to see all the networks that I should be able to, but, after an attempted connection timing out, the networks are no longer found by network manager. What is very odd it that this problem seems to be local to the wifi networks in use at my university. I was perfectly able to find and connect to networks in a cafe yesterday. It has crossed my mind that my credentials could have been blacklisted from the wifi (my torrenting is distros and copyright free material, obviously) but this can't be the case because my phone and other laptop connect fine with the same credentials.
 I should make clear that in some buildings of my university, I am able to see and connect to eduroam, so I'm pretty sure the problem isn't related to how I have the eduroam connection configured. 
 The hardware I am using is Qualcomm Atheros AR9285 Wireless Network Adapter (PCI-Express) and the ath9k kernel driver. I am running kernel version Linux 5.17.8-arch1-1.
 I can and would provide logs but because I am in the dark about what is going wrong I don't know which logs would be relevant as the ones I have looked through don't appear to show anything obviously wrong. I would greatly appreciate any pointers about what could be going on here. Thank you :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I've recently successfully installed xmobar-git on my main VM and had fun tweaking it. I've now attempted a similar installation on a different VM, and I'm literally going insane with it.
 I get weird errors telling me that some package is broken. I've attempted to solve this by googling, reinstalling and doing the rain-dance. Can't get it to work, although it worked a couple days ago.
 Here is the error I get, note the fact the I check for installed packages in the end and they are identical to the packages on the working VM, yet it complains a bunch and won't let me install it. I can't think of how to proceed with this.

 Im using xprop to get the names of windows, and whenever there is greek text involed, it is displayed as follows:
 \316\221\316\273\316\273\316\267\316\273\316\277\316\263\317\201\316\261\317\206\316\257\316\261 
 I am thinking that it has to do with fonts but Im not sure. I have ttg-mgopen(TrueType fonts containing glyphs for the Latin and Greek alphabet) installed.
 The issue doesn't seem to be terminal emulator specific, as the same gibberish appear on my i3 status bar(I'm using a script that, using xprop, displays the window names in status bar).
 I don't know what other info to provide, that can be useful so write me in the comments and I will edit this post accordingly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I've been trying to make some custom mapping on my keyboard with `xmodmap` and `setxkbmap` but it's just too much of a black box for me ): I read the arch wiki regarding Xorg keyboard configuration and other sources but most of the times they just give some commands but doesn't explain how things work. So far I'm just unable to debug anything at all.
 Regarding the mapping, I tried to `xmodmap -e keycode 108 = Return` and it works, but the behavior is slightly different, mainly the real Return key keeps sending the press while being hold, and the mapped Right Alt key just send it once, until release.
 Does someone have resources where I can read about how these things are handled ? Or do you have experience with it ? I'm totally lost right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Epson è una multinazionale giapponese tra i maggiori e più importanti produttori mondiali di stampanti e apparecchiature relative alla gestione dei dati e all'imaging.Ben 80 anni fa, nel mese di maggio 1942, fu fondata Daiwa Kogyo, l'azienda da cui è nata Epson. Anzi Seiko Epson, come si chiama oggi: nei primi anni di vita, infatti, gli elementi che hanno alimentato la crescita dell'azienda erano incentrati sul perfezionamento delle tecnologie di microlavorazione e di elaborazione ad alta precisione sviluppate per gli orologi e il loro impiego in altri campi applicativi.Daiwa Kogyo fu creata proprio da un negoziante di orologi locale, Hisao Yamazaki, e ricevette il supporto della famiglia di imprenditori che fondò il Gruppo Seiko.

L'Epson Museum Suwa, situato nella sede di Suwa (prefettura di Nagano, Giappone), è stato inaugurato oggi proprio con l'intento di descrivere l'intera storia della società, dalla fondazione ai giorni nostri.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Arch Linux for like 6 months. I installed it with kde-plasma and recently moved into i3 window manager. Ever since I started using i3 my system halts unexpectedly. I mean I work like 2-3 hours and suddenly the computer halts and I have to restart it. And sometimes even weirder, it restart automatically. I have three questions?
  
Why does this happens?
 How to fix it?
 Am I hacked?
