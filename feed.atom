        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 When using secure boot with custom keys, and luks full disk encryption tied to the TPM PCR 7 (secure boot state), a system can be encrypted but booted unattended up to the login prompt (GDM in my case).
 What steps, if any, can be taken to secure the login prompt in order to achieve security level similar to a luks password prompt at boot ? 
 Thanks !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have used pre-fab distros for years. I got hooked on building Arch into my dream machine about 6 months ago and have built and rebuilt my OS at least 15 times. I have decided to build a server without a DE and only the items I need to serve what I need. I do have a monitor on it and would like Xterm to look as good as possible.
 If I am understanding the Arch Wiki there is no config file and all configuration must be done through X Resources. I could use some tips or opinions on the best settings and the best way to go about making it look decent. I am using zsh.... I'm sure some will find that to be blasphemy but I love the powerlevel look and I have built a decent config that I am used to.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pretty much the title.
 So I ran Arch on my previous PC (using gnome), and one day after an update my audio started playing up in a kind of peculiar way. Let's say that I have two options in my settings to pick from for audio output, Analogue Hi Res, and Digital Hi Res. When I would boot and triy to do something like play a song, the song would be stuck in a kind of "pending to play" state until I open the settings panel and changed from whatever output device had been selected on boot (let's say digital) to whatever option wasn't yet selected (so let's say analogue).
 Ok so it's choosing the wrong audio device on startup yeah? Nope lol. After choosing the correct output device and having sound play, if I would pause or halt the system audio for even a short amount of time (I'm talking less than 10 seconds), when I would resume playback the audio player would be stuck in the same halted loading state until I go back into the settings panel and change the output device back again (so back to digital from analogue in this example). This would have to have been repeated every time I paused system audio, because the audio would just continuously ping pong between analogue and digital.
 I thought this was just something I had done stupidly having had Arch running on this system for over 4 years, and didn't bother digging into the problem because I was building a new machine anyway.
 Well, I built the new machine, and it was working fine for a few weeks until today. I ran a system update and noticed that wireplumber was in conflict with pipewire-media-session. I chose to replace the lib wireplumber, and then boom. The output device switching issue resumed again.
 Does anyone have any idea what's doing on? Or where I would start to debug this? It's driving me mad hahaha.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a laptop where I set up an installation of Arch and an installation of Debian. Whenever I boot into Arch, I get a message "start job is running for /dev/disk/by-uuid/aa....", which lasts a minute and a half, followed by the message "dependency failed for /dev/disk/by-uuid/aa...." and then "dependency failed for Swaps" (note the uuid value shown matches the swap partition's). After this the system does successfully boot into Arch. Any help you can offer will be much appreciated, I have provided more details bellow.
 - The Arch installation uses sytemd-boot to boot, Debian's comes using grub.
 - The two installations each have their own root partition, they share an EFI partition, a swap partition, and a storage partition I made to store pictures, documents, etc.
 - As far as I can tell the fstab file in the Arch installation is correct (has the partitions I would expect to be there).
 -The computer defaults to Debian's boot menu, where there is an option to boot into Arch. I have tried going into the BIOS and entering through Arch's boot menu, when I do this the problem persists.
 ​
 Once again, any help will be greatly appreciated.
 Edit: Added a detail I thought was important.

 I've just gotten up and running with my first ever Arch install, on my laptop, and almost everything is working great. 
 The one snag is: I've encrypted the hard drive using [https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#LVM_on_LUKS](LVM on LUKS). At boot, I'm prompted to type the encryption passphrase. With a USB keyboard, I can type it in no problem. But during boot my laptop's built-in keyboard is non-functional - no keystrokes register at all, it's as though it's disconnected - so I have no way of booting without a USB keyboard attached. 
 The keyboard itself is physically fine, and works perfectly in the bootloader and in the DE.

 I made the installation medium using Rufus, installation is in UEFI mode.

 Any idea why this happens, and how to fix it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I did an update this morning and found that all proton games would crash afterwards.
 I couldn't pin down exactly what the problem is but it appears that all proton versions, experimental and otherwise would cause directx errors. This was with forcing radv and regular radeon drivers. 
 I ended up restoring from a timeshift backup for now as I didn't have a lot of time to crawl through journalctl.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[microcode and DSDT are examples where an extra initramfs file is inserted before the regular one (generated by mkinitcpio). So how does kernel deal with those?
 I know for the regular one, such as \initramfs-linux.img, kernel would mount it to / and execute the /init file. But if there are more than one initrd= params, does boot loader load all of them in one shot to some memory area and kernel process them one by one according to some rules? Does kernel unmount/delete the first one before mounting the next one to /? For example, if I insert an intel-ucode.img in front of initramfs-linux.img, does kernel also mount it at /? what happens afterwards then since there is no /init file in the ucode image, so how does kernel know what to do with it? and how does kernel know it needs to load the next initramfs file which is initramfs-linux.img?
 I tried adding debug boot parameter, but still didn't see any log file under /run/initramfs/, what did I miss?

 Right now I have qtile installed as a window manager, and I'm using picom as a compositor. My problem is that when changing my shell fomr bash to zsh (or any other, like fish), the opacity in my terminal (alacritty) just stops working.
 I Have no idea what the problem could be, since by using bash and picom it works just fine. Also alacritty itself does not change its background opacity when I set it inside the configuration file, but only if I have picom running.
 Any help?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, few weeks ago, I switched to using Wayland. Setup was quite easy following the wiki. However, when I try to run XWayland applications (wine/proton games in my case), I get massive stuttering - especially when moving camera or when character are moving in the scene. The weird thing is, there was originally no such problem and this seems to only start last week. I went through the wiki again, reinstalling what was needed, but without any luck. I am running Gnome, but had the same problem when I switched to KDE on Wayland. 
 I also saw wiki mentioning EGLStreams vs GBM buffer APIs, but I not sure what to make of it as this only occurs in XWayland applications - native games that are not running through wine work flawlessly.
 Am I missing something or do others have the same problem?

  /usr/bin/dkms: line 1033: sha512: command not found 
 Looks like the script hardcodes the command sha512. Looks like this is a change introduced recently ([GitHub]) and breaks dkms on Arch.
 If anyone else experiences a similar problem, soft-linking sha512 to sha512sum seems to solve the problem for now. (sudo ln -s /usr/bin/sha512sum /usr/bin/sha512)
 Although I'm curious, should we suggest the upstream to change this behavior (how?), or should we suggest Arch developers to add a patch to the dkms package (changing sha512 to sha512sum)?

 Starting version 251.2-1-arch /dev/sdc2: clean, 311370/15605760 files, 3267143/62416384 blocks
 Using alt+Ctrl+f2
 I am able to login and edit things around
 In googling attempts to fix the issue. I have Both added nomodeset and removed it. Along with quiet. In all different variations and then regenerate the configuration file for grub. All has not worked. 
 I have installed Nvidia video drivers with Sudo -S nvidia
 Did not help
 I have tried adding systemd to the begging of the HOOK line. 
 Just recently I got a new msg on boot telling me to run fsck manually. I did. Rebooted. And I'm back at the same screen.
 Anyone know how I can get past this to a desktop.
 Please be descriptive as possible I'm not great with Linux.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You guys will understand me. Rebooted my laptop and suddenly the boot process is hanging with no reason given. It just stopped in a Bluetooth firmware warning.
 Opened another TTY and checked with journalctl - getting a “xyz is not an ELF file”. Can’t remember which file it was to begin with. But it was causing NetworkManager to fail. 
 Booted into the live USB Chrootd into the install pacman -Qo’d the lib file that journalctl was complaining about, and then proceeded down a pathway of:
  
pacman -R <package the file belongs to>
 Receive ELF error for another file
 Repeat until I landed at kdecoration
  
Turns out somehow this package was corrupt, and it was somehow causing a cascading “is not an ELF file” issues throughout a bunch of /usr/lib/lib* files.
  
pacman -R kdecoration
 pacman -Syu kdecoration
 exit
 reboot
 it boots!!
 pat self on the back
  
I fixed my Arch BTW. Thanks for listening.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not sure when it started; I've had this problem for months. I use GNOME-Shell, and lately tracker-miner-fs-3 has been hogging a full CPU core and just devouring my RAM until it either freezes my system or I kill the process (which restarts itself eventually as well). I'm running a quad core CPU with 16G RAM, so it's not just my computer being a POS. I figured it would resolve itself with updates eventually, but it's been months and hasn't. 
 Is there anything I can do to figure out why it's doing this, or fix it? 
 I've taken some screenshots of the system monitor and some tracker commands I ran to see if it had any errors, but nothing seems to show up.

At more than a million lines of code, it is arguably one of the most complex programs that is still in active development today. Since the late 1990s, the Linux kernel has been used in both computationally intensive projects as well as barebones embedded applications.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to create my own customized arch "fork". I've been making the installer iso with archiso but there's a few things I'm not fully clear on.
  
Archiso just makes the installer, right? If I use it to install the os doesn't it just install normal arch Linux? I need to know how to change this. For example: Having a different /etc/os-release file generated when it installs.
 
Does adding an /etc/os-release file to the airootfs of archiso change the installed OS name?
 
Is the desktop environment on the live iso copied over to the installed system, with all of the settings on it? How would I do this?
 
 I'm making this for fun, please don't be an asshole just because I'm "doing it wrong" or whatever.

 Now system hangs multiple times during the day. Especialy when I use a browser or play some Steam games.

Come nel caso delle precedenti versioni del sistema operativo Microsoft, tuttavia, Windows 10 e 11 non includono un'opzione per proteggere PDF con password.Eppure fare in modo che un documento PDF sia leggibile soltanto dalla persona in possesso della password corretta si rivela spesso molto utile.Buona parte delle soluzioni software che permettono di proteggere i documenti PDF sono a pagamento e questo tipo di funzione di solito fa parte di costose applicazioni.La buona notizia è che esiste un programma open source in grado di crittografare i documenti PDF usando algoritmi come AES-256 supportato ad esempio Adobe Acrobat 8 e successivi.Il software si chiama PDFEncrypt, utilizza la libreria open source iTextPDF e il suo codice sorgente è disponibile su GitHub.Scaricabile da questa pagina (consigliamo l'uso della versione portabile che non necessita di installazione), PDFEncrypt consente di proteggere PDF senza dover acquistare alcun costoso software.Per usare il programma basta estrarre il contenuto del file Zip in una cartella di propria scelta quindi cliccare due volte sull'eseguibile PDFEncrypt.exe.Il funzionamento è semplicissimo: basta indicare il file PDF da proteggere con password nel campo Choose a file to encrypt, il nome del file che si desidera ottenere e dove si vuole memorizzarlo nel campo Choose a destination for the encrypted file.Nel campo Specify a password si può specificare la password richiesta per l'apertura del file (dovrebbe essere scelta in maniera tale che sia sufficientemente lunga e complessa): con un clic su Generate PDFEncrypt si occupa della generazione di una password adeguata.

PDFEncrypt non nasconde i caratteri inseriti nel campo della password con i classici asterischi o pallini.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been having this problem since a month probably. This is more than an year old installation but earlier I didn't have this problem.
 I have uncommented en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8 from /etc/locale.gen, have run locale-gen and have done localectl set-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8 already. This was done during the initial installation but the problem presented itself a month back.
 The problem is, when running locale I get the following error:
 locale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory LANG=en_US LC_CTYPE=C.UTF-8 LC_NUMERIC="en_US" LC_TIME="en_US" LC_COLLATE="en_US" LC_MONETARY="en_US" LC_MESSAGES=C LC_PAPER="en_US" LC_NAME="en_US" LC_ADDRESS="en_US" LC_TELEPHONE="en_US" LC_MEASUREMENT="en_US" LC_IDENTIFICATION="en_US" LC_ALL= 
 And when running locale -a, I get:
 locale: Cannot set LC_COLLATE to default locale: No such file or directory C C.UTF-8 POSIX en_US.utf8 
 Due to this, applications fallback to the default 'C' locale but some applications like easyeffects just fail to launch. I have already tried editing /etc/locale.gen and running locale-gen etc., but to no avail. What else can I do?
