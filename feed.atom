        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use a nvidia card (1660 TI) and to prevent screen tearing i of course turned on Force Full Composition Pipeline. I of course saved it, and most of the time it turns on perfectly and works fine. However, sometimes when i turn my computer it doesnt turn on. Most of the time it is just my left most monitor that is off and it is enabled on my other two. Sometimes though it is two of my monitors and on rare circumstances its off on all three. Anyone know how to prevent this from happening?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The command prompt in older Windows versions annoyingly doesn’t let you copy-paste stuff inside sometimes. Windows 11 and the latest versions of Windows 10 have resolved this problem to a great extent. If you’re still facing this issue, this guide will show you how to enable copy and paste functionality within the command prompt.
    
We also discuss command line text selection and current line clearing, as they go hand in hand with copy-paste techniques. Altogether, these workarounds can help you leverage the command prompt like a typical word processor tool. 
    
Note: in case of trouble with command prompt, you can self-diagnose and resolve any pending issues using the Update Troubleshooter or SetUpDiag.

However this is less likely to be a kernel/driver issue as I edited /sys/class/leds/hda::mute/brightness from 0 to 1 the mute LED lights up, switching it back to 0 turns off the LED. So the system clearly identifies my mute LED, but it's not working somehow.
 I did this workaround to my sound server for microphone to work.

This way you can see at a glance if it’s something important and determine whether it’s worth unlocking your phone or not. But having this information on your lock screen also means you are at risk of sharing more than you’d like to. 
    
The details visible on your lock screen may not always be sensitive, but beyond everything, this info is no one else’s business but yours. A convenient method to keep your data private would be to hide notifications from your Android lock screen. This does not require that you root your phone, and it’s easier than you think.

 It's my hope to develop a workflow that's efficient and intuitive to myself. I'm guessing that's everyone, no matter the system you use.
 I'm currently using KDE (I know), and konsole with the bash and tmux. I've been considering a move to i3, bwspm, or xfce to trim down own resource usage, and focus more on the the tasks I'm performing.
 What does your workflow look like? What tools do you use for system administration?
 Do you write scripts to automate most of your tasks?
 Looking forward to your replies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear fellow Arch enjoyers,
 I have a problem which is not directly related to arch. However, I am sure that I can help myself with your knowhow.
 _________________________________________________________________
 Background:
 When I assembled my first PC 4 years ago, I had no experience at all with PCs, let alone with building them. My colleagues helped me assemble the PC and set up practically everything for me. Among the installed parts was a wireless network card which I connected to my Gigabyte Z370 HD3 mainboard.
 Since the beginning, however, I had a problem, namely that my PC always started up by itself after I had shut it down. After quite a bit of trial and error, I found out that it was the network card which caused the problem.
 I sold it and stayed without wifi and bluetooth for a few years until I recently bought a new network card (Gigabyte GC-WBAX210) and behold, the same problem occurs again.
 ___________________________________________________________________
 Troubleshooting:
 At first I thought of wake on lan or better said wake on wireless lan but all settings in the BIOS and in the network manager are disabled. I have also tried several interfaces on my mainboard but without success. As with the previous model, the card is connected via a PCIEx1 interface and an internal USB 2 cable. After extensive reading of the wiki and other posts, I am unfortunately still at the same point.
 ____________________________________________________________________
 Request:
 I would therefore like to ask you if you know of any ways of dealing with this problem in arch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having reliable smoke detectors in your home at all times is a must-have, but you usually have to be home to know if they’re going off. With the X-Sense Wi-Fi Smoke Detector, you’re notified wherever you may be. This can help you take action in an emergency even if you’re at work, out shopping, or on vacation.  I was lucky enough to get to try a three-pack out for myself.

Overview of Features
    
For my review, I received the X-Sense Wi-Fi Smoke Detector three-pack, but you can also buy a single smoke detector. The first thing you’ll notice is how compact and small they are. They’re noticeably smaller than standard smoke detectors at 3 in. x 3 in. x 1.9 in. However, this doesn’t mean they’re less capable of getting the job done.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am experiencing random app freezes in i3wm. The app itself freezes, but i3wm and other programs works normally. They unfreeze themselves after 10 - 20 seconds. Switching workspace during a freeze event causes the "screenshot" of the previous workspace to remain on the frozen app's window.
  
The behavior is observed to appear on VSCode, Anbox, Electron, etc ... Now it's happening more than 3 times in a few hours.
 Such behavior don't appear on GNOME, no matter running on Xorg or Wayland.
 During such freeze, I don't observe any CPU / Memory high usage. I only have Intel GPU and should be running xf86-intel GPU driver.
 I don't use compton, but I do run gsd-xsettings on i3 startup if that matters.
  
Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Sigle di questo tipo presenti nel nome del router stanno a significare lo standard supportato dal dispositivo.Nei router più recenti compare la sigla AX a indicare che il prodotto supporta lo standard WiFi 6 (802.11 ax)Sulla carta WiFi 6 consente di raggiungere velocità di trasferimento dati fino a 9,6 Gbps anche se all'atto pratico è estremamente difficile avvicinarsi a questo valore. Molto dipende anche dai dispositivi WiFi collegati: se non sono compatibili WiFi 6 e se non possono i canali più ampi le prestazioni massime risulteranno molto più ridotte: ne parliamo nel dettaglio nell'articolo che abbiamo citato poco sopra.La sigla AC fa riferimento al supporto per lo standard WiFi 5 (WiFi 5) che sulla carta non permette di superare i 6,9 Gbps in condizioni ottimali.La sigla N indica i router più vecchi che supportano solo WiFi 4 (802.11 n) e che sono contraddistinti da prestazioni complessivamente più mediocri.Tutti i router AX, AC e N possono lavorare sulle frequenze dei 2,4 GHz e dei 5 GHz.L'indicazione BE non è ancora utilizzata e sarà parte integrante del nome del modello di tutti quei router compatibili WiFi 7.- WiFi 6E.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[State cercando un NAS completo e performante che faccia da media server?QNAP ha appena presentato il nuovo NAS HS-264 progettato appunto per la fruizione di contenuti multimediali in ambito domestico.Dotato di collegamento di rete con 2 porte 2,5 GbE, due uscite 4K HDMI, streaming/transcodifica multimediale 4K e il supporto per decine di applicazioni installabili a richiesta, QNAP HS-264 combina le funzionalità di un più tradizionale NAS con un'esperienza evoluta incentrata sulla multimedialità e all’insegna della massima silenziosità.

Di dimensioni compatte, simili a quelle di un set-top box da salotto, HS-264 è un NAS che 'sotto la scocca' integra un processore quad-core Intel Celeron N5105 a 2 GHz oltre a 8 GB di memoria RAM.Si tratta di un dispositivo a 2 vani che può accogliere due hard disk o SSD SATA 6 Gbps da 2,5' o 3,5' assicurando un ottimo potenziale in termini di banda per il backup, la condivisione e lo streaming multimediale ad alta velocità.]]></summary>

 i tried booting my machine today and received following error message during booting:
 I am using the hardened kernel
 5.16.18-hardened1-1-hardened 
 The error message:
 Starting version 250.4-2.arch /dev/sda2: clean, ... libbpf: failed to find valid kernel BTF: -3 libbpf: Error loading vmlinux BTF: -3 libbpf: failed to load object 'iterators_bpf' libbpf: failed to load BPF skeleton 'iterators_bpf': -3 Failed load could be due to wrong endianess 
 It says vmlinux not vmlinuz. After a few seconds it goes on with the boot process. uname returns the hardened kernel verison.
 ​
 Any idea what I can do? Is it related to the hardened kernel update I read about here?

Una rivoluzione per gli standard wireless è invece attesa con l'approvazione delle specifiche WiFi 7 (802.11 be).Cos'è WiFi 7 e perché sarà rivoluzionario lo abbiamo già spiegato: in breve aumenteranno le prestazioni e la stabilità della connessione wireless grazie alla possibilità di usare canali larghi 320 MHz con la possibilità di gestire fino a 9,6 Gbps con i dispositivi WiFi 7 4x4.Grazie alla nuova modulazione 4096-QAM si potranno ottenere fino a 40 Gbps (ovvero ben 5 GB/s) sulla banda dei 6 GHz e aggregare le bande WiFi con Multi-Link Operation (MLO).

Broadcom ha già presentato i primi suoi chip che rispettano le specifiche WiFi 7 attualmente in fase di approvazione.Per il segmento maggiormente mainstream, compresi quindi i dispositivi domestici, Broadcom ha svelato i chip BCM67263 e BCM6726.Il primo permette l'utilizzo di canali fino a 320 MHz sulla banda dei 6 GHz per una velocità massima di 11,5 Gbps; il secondo può operare sulle bane a 2,4, 5 e 6 GHz con canali da 160 MHz e velocità di 5,75 Gbps.I chip WiFi 7 rivolti ai dispositivi per il mercato business sono invece BCMN43740 e BVMN43720.]]></summary>

The main pain point this presents is for those using the latest-generation Intel "Alder Lake" processors with a mix of performance and power efficiency cores.

 Im trying to get spotify-tui to work on my new setup.
 Initial idea was to have spotifyd work together with spt.
 But i did not get spotifyd to work since spt cant find the "Device". 
 Conclusion is that there is probably something wrong with the .config file to spotifyd.
 ​
 The new plan is to just make spotify work with spt since it does not require any setup to work.
 But it kind of kills the idea of spt if i have to launch spotify visually every time i want to use spt.
 Is it possible to make spotify run as a background process during boot so that i can simply launch spt directly?
 ​

A partire dal prossimo mese di maggio Telsy renderà disponibile per le aziende italiane e per la Pubblica Amministrazione un prodotto per la sicurezza con funzionalità i antivirus, antimalware, antispyware e antiransomware.Si tratta di un prodotto interamente 'made in Italy' perché progettato, sviluppato e gestito in Italia; il risultato del lavoro di un team di esperti in materia di cybersecurity, degli interventi svolti dal Telsy Incident Response Team e dell'esperienza maturata negli anni dall'azienda nella realizzazione di prodotti e servizi per la sicurezza delle informazioni e delle comunicazioni.Il timing dell'annuncio di Telsy non è casuale: l'Italia e i Paesi europei guardano con sempre maggiore sospetto alle soluzioni per la sicurezza informatica sviluppate e gestite all'estero.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the old saying goes, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” That seems to be the words to live by for many PC users. Not only do they not jump to upgrade to new Windows versions, but some also don’t do it several times over. A recent study showed that more users still use Windows XP than Windows 11.

Slow to Upgrade to Windows 11
    
Windows 11 was released last fall, yet only 1.4 percent of users upgraded to it. Windows XP was introduced in August 2001. That’s a month before the 9-11 tragedy. I had children in grade school then – they are now adults. My only mobile phone was a bag phone in my car, and I was using a Bondi Blue iMac.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This might be a dumb question and I'm pretty sure it's not possible but I want to be certain.
 This afternoon I moved from mkinitcpio to booster (mainly becase of the speed in image generation and slight boot time improvement) and it's been great, the EFISTUB configuration was even simpler. The only thing I'm missing is LUKS autounlocking at boot. I only use a keyfile for unlocking when I'm at home, otherwise I input the password.
 With mkinitcpio this is achieved easily, my USB is automounted by fstab and then the keyfile is used to unlock the partition, if the USB can't be read in 3s then it defaults to password prompt by using the luks option "keyfile-timeout".
 When I first booted using the image generated by booster it gave me an error saying that keyfile-timeout option wasn't recognised, I selected my previous boot entry, then looked up the booster manpage and found this:
  
rd.luks.options=opt1,opt2 a comma-separated list of LUKS flags. Supported options are discard, same-cpu-crypt, submit-from-crypt-cpus, no-read-workqueue, no-write-workqueue.
  
I just want to know if there's a workaround for the keyfile timeout. I'll continue to use booster even if it isn't but it would be nice to have autounlocking. Sorry for the long post lol and thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know that in many contexts, "modern" installers for Linux like Flatpak, Snap, and Appimage get a lot of hate, with the recommendation being "Just use default repos, AUR, or install from source." 
 That being said, it is a fairly recurring phenomenon for the AUR version of an application to be behind or even abandoned, whereas most developers have an official release on one of these modern platforms. AUR repos are not audited for malware so it is really not safe to use AUR helpers to automate the install, meaning the expectation is that you manually examine the source and recompile every update, which is fairly unrealistic. 
 Regardless of the standard arguments about "sandboxing" etc. it seems pretty straightforward to prefer an official release over a user repackaging for apps that are not already in the standard repos. 
 As a bonus, the updates can be automated with relatively high trust. 
 I am curious if there is a legitimate technical reason why my reasoning is fallacious. Anyone want to poke a hole in my theory?

Another specific data type it stores is your location history, which may prove helpful or intrusive depending on your perspective. Either way you have some degree of control over Google’s record of the places you’ve visited. If you’re wary of the feature, you can turn it off completely. Deleting location data at specific intervals is also possible. We show you how to manage these tasks, but first, let’s discuss what Google location history does and whether it’s something you need.

 I started out intending to get a Lenovo T model. T14 is the common designation on their website. But I've also liked the idea of the 2-in-1 where you can flip the screen back and it makes a tablet. I just can't decide. I'm sure I'll live with whatever I get (at least it will work off a battery :))
 I intend to run Arch on it with cutefish desktop or something light. I want the fastest boot time possible. But I also plan on trying GENTOO as a hobby project. 
 I do A/V stuff for the church and I'm hoping to do more website design. Maybe get into app development.

 So, recently, my friend told me how his uni staff has upgraded their Internet connection in the dorms to gigabit speeds; in the process, they introduced authentication by 802.1x using the college Moodle user name and password. The Internet is all LAN and this change means most routers students install were rendered useless because few, if any, know this protocol, and few had boxes that could work with things like OpenWRT etc.
 I suggested to him, since we anyway had a 4th gen i7 low power mini PC laying around mostly collecting dust due to its internal SSD and SATA port getting weirdly broken, to use that in order to have it handle the 802.1x part. Of course, the easy and crappy way would have been to load Windows and use the guide provided by the college to configure the network and j…]]></summary>

 How much RAM are y'all using?
 On getting a laptop I can get a Lenovo flex 5 with 8gb soldered. Or I can pay more for a T model and get 16gb. Id probably get the flex if I could upgrade ram as they have the same processor. But I kinda scared of not being able to upgrade ram. Even though the internet is full of websites saying it's been common I disagree because I've never actually encountered that in the many many computers and laptops I've seen in my life. Mobiles probably are common, but not full computers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm using an integrated Intel GPU and a discrete NVIDIA GPU (I use the nvidia package) on my laptop. Since one of the latest Mesa or KDE updates, it all became so sluggish. The KDE Wayland session felt slow, so I came back to X11, which feels better but it's slow nonetheless. Today, while launching Konsole, I noticed these messages:
 libGL error: MESA-LOADER: failed to open i965: /usr/lib/dri/i965_dri.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory (search paths /usr/lib/dri, suffix _dri) libGL error: failed to load driver: i965 
 /usr/lib/dri/i965_dri.so doesn't exist... strange: so I checked which package provides it, and I found this:
 $ pacman -F /usr/lib/dri/i965_dri.so usr/lib/dri/i965_dri.so is owned by extra/mesa 21.3.7-1 
 The mystery deepens. I reinstalled mesa and noticed it's at version 22.0.1-3, so I updated the pacman database and the command above returned mesa-amber instead. Since mesa and mesa-amber conflict with each other, what am I supposed to do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So there's this app called Cantata that use daily to control Music Player Daemon, mainly because its MPRIS2 implementation is really solid and the app is lightweight too.
 Unfortunately though, the Cantata repository on GitHub has been archived: https://github.com/CDrummond/cantata
 Cantata still works great for me, but it might break at some point in the future, so it's pretty much inevitable that the cantata package will be removed from community.
 The question I have is: When/how is determined that a package will get removed from the official repos?

 still want to post this though in case anyone knows WTF happened?
 ​
 things I had tried:
 - restart computer
 - restart modem/router
 - restarting dhcpcd service
 - turning the interfaces on & off
 - release / rebind from dhcpcd
 - restored timeshift backup from a few days ago
 ​
 None of the above got my ethernet back to working. After finishing the very bottom of this post, I rebooted and tried ping one last time and it worked. WTF??

 I didn't change anything - went to bed with ethernet working. Woke up with it not working. No reboot or anything

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[C'è uno smartphone, presentato in questi giorni, sul quale non è possibile glissare. Si tratta del nuovo Vivo X Note, un dispositivo che riporta in auge il concetto di phablet, un tempo molto utilizzato per riferirsi a tutti quei dispositivi che integrano le funzioni di un telefono ma che, soprattutto per dimensioni e implicazioni in termini di produttività, sono quasi equiparabili a un tablet.Vivo X Note è un prodotto senza dubbio impressionante. È molto grande e monta un enorme display da 7 pollici con un rapporto d'aspetto 21:10; ha bordi arrotondati e risulterà piuttosto difficile da usare con una sola mano. Il rapporto d'aspetto è insolito per gli smartphone ma si rivela una soluzione ideale per la visualizzazione di contenuti multimediali e il multitasking.Lo schermo utilizza un pannello Samsung AMOLED con una risoluzione pari a 3080 x 1440 pixel supportata nativamente.Il display è di alta qualità, come conferma la valutazione A+ di DisplayMate, assicura una luminosità massima di 1.500 nits e una copertura della gamma di colori DCI-P3 pari al 112%.

Nascosto dietro lo schermo c'è un lettore di impronte digitali a ultrasuoni (si tratta di un Qualcomm 3D Sonic Max): è talmente ampio che può acquisire contemporaneamente due impronte digitali migliorando la sicurezza.Per quanto concerne la restante parte dell'hardware Vivo X Note monta il SoC Qualcomm al momento più avanzato e performante, lo Snapdragon 8 Gen 1.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 a weird thing happened:
 /etc/fstab line:  LABEL="BtrfsRoot" /home btrfs subvol=home,defaults,compress=zstd:1,noatime 0 2 
 This subvolume has been mounted like 50 times without issue. But one of the recents boots got stuck with this message:
 A start job is running for /dev/disk/by-uuid/....
 I rebooted via Ctrl-Alt-Del and the very next boot went fine. Looking at the kernel log, no "Mounting /home" message is there. But no HW related errors either.
 What could be the reason?
 Updated Arch Stable, linux-zen kernel, btrfs fs spanning two NVME disks.
