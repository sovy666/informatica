ALSA I’ve gotten to a point where I can sort of get it working temporarily if I switch my interface’s driver from output + input to just input and back again in PAVU. But I haven’t found any way to just have it work. No driver configuration has lead to the mic being recognized by gnome settings either. 
 Is there a general way to set up focusrite interfaces for recording or just general mic use (discord, etc) in gnome/arch? If someone has a solution they use I’d love to hear it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have numerous issues with Cinnamon after updates over the last few months. The main ones being that some of my apps won't display properly; such as Steam, when i go to launch steam via the cinnamon menu, it starts a fully black box where the steam window should be. Thus, I can only start steam in the terminal to actually see/use it - strange since it references the same command. I also am unable to change some of the themes (namely the icon theme or the mouse pointer theme). I have tried a few things now, but it's just really getting on my nerves. I'm assuming that if I can just wipe cinnamon off and re-install it fresh, I'm hoping it will just resolve all the problems I've got. I'm not sure what impact or problems I might create doing this on my main PC, so I wanted to ask advice on how to best do this without making myself more headaches afterwards. I tried just removing it via the usual command below, but after I re-install cinnamon, it simply restored my previous settings/problems (I'm assuming it keeps the config files, maybe do I need Rsc? I am a little worried on running the -c option if so).
 $sudo pacman -Rns cinnamon $sudo pacman -S cinnamon 
 FYI I start my PC, and launch X via typing $ startx, and my xinitrc file simply just has the exec set to the below. So I should be ok to do this before running startx.
 exec cinnamon-session

Now I wonder if I should just ditch the dual-boot and go back to using full dedicated Arch (I did in the past but with derivatives like Manjaro and Antergos - when it was still alive that is).

 Ok so i am avid (although nooby) arch user. I like Dark Souls, i like Sekiro and likewise i like Arch. 
 I use i3-wm + ranger + gh cli + code/vim on a daily basis. I seek a substitute for Lattice vhdl IDE.
 For now i have already installed ghdl with LLVM backend and made a Makefile.
 I only require two more things: a way to assign pins (like pin planner) and a way to upload program to fpga stream.

 Do you know any solutions to my problem?

I tried few stuff from AUR, but it was either made for xorg or gnome.. Also could not use wf-recorder which throws this error compositor doesn't support wlr-screencopy-unstable-v1 ( i am guessing it works on select few wayland compositors ). 
 Audio recording is not a priority so I can do without it. I want to be able to bind it to a shortcut and it should be able to select rectangular region for capture.

I was wondering why that is the case. And please don't say something like "it's a dependency because it depends on it" because it clearly doesn't, all other distributions I know of don't have such weird dependencies and packaging with the GNOME stuff. I know this is very nit-picky, but when I spent so much time customizing my install, I want it to be just the way I want it to.

 My setup: 1. Latest arch 2. Intel i7 12700K (Alder Lake) 3. Wayland + sddm + Sway 4. Nouveau driver
 After upgrade my gpu from 1080 to 3080 i have glitches, stuttering, lags on alacritty. The same issue with deault sway config.
 so i've decided to use intel gpu and forget about nvidia (i have win11 for games anyway).
 I added Nouveau driver to blacklist via modprobe. After reboot sddm doesn't start :/ Just: 
 Starting version 250.4-2-arch /dev/....: clean blablabla
 It looks like kernel is unable to recognize intel gpu
 Questions: 1. How to get information about Intel Integrated GPU? lshw, lspci show nothing about it. 2. How to force to use intel driver instead of discrete gpu?
 SOLUTION
 Disable CSM Feature in ASUS BIOS (Boot tab), iCPU will be unlocked in Advanced tab -> System Agent -> Graphics..

 Setting an environment variable like GTK_THEME=Mint-Y-Dark-Aqua in /etc/environment fixes this, but then the libadwaita apps (like Gnome Software) have their stylesheets completely f*cked up. They seem to then use a legacy Adwaita theme with the graphics on various lists and switches being extremely glitched.
 I don't understand this behaviour. I expected that libadwaita or maybe even gtk4 apps in general to resist theming, but not the usual gtk3 apps with CSD. The same apps also don't get properly themed even if the "legacy" theme is set in Gnome, rather than Cinnamon. Eg. in the screenshot the gtk theme is set to a Mint theme, but both the tweaks and disks app clearly uses the old Adwaita stylesheet.
 What's the reason for this and how to fix it?
 EDIT: For some reason, setting the GTK theme to adw-gtk3 (the gtk3 theme mimicking the look of the new libadwaita apps does work; but for example the Mint-Y themes don't, as the screenshot shows)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I installed Archlinux last year, and it was a disaster from the start because I was struggling to understand some of the basic concepts. I took time to finally read about the things that were causing me trouble, such as Grub, Sudo, networking and some other random issue.
 FF today, and I was feeling like an imposter on Arch. I began asking myself if I could swim. So I decided, hey; let's try installing to a VM without diving into man or info files except maybe for a reference, and stick with only the Arch User Install guide. Granted, I still need to do some system maintenance.
 I cautiously booted the April Installer in VirtualBox via UEFI mode, and got nervous that maybe it wouldn't work because of vbox issues in the past. I had to choose the EFI image, and then to test, I attempted the archinstall script. This failed when installing packages. I felt defeated for a brief moment, and then remembered that was only to see how it would work. No big deal.
 I then began to follow the Install Guide,which I myself, and many in the Arch community recommend. The time was set, the partitions were made, the system was pacstrapped and it all seemed to go much easier than I recall. Could this work from the first go, I questioned myself? Something must have been done incorrectly, this is not going to work. Having installed LXQt, I ran systemctl enable sddm and hoped for the best.
 Aha, I was greeted with the login screen, and no user listed. I had forgotten a simple useradd So, I switched to tty2 and made the user and rebooted. I then proceeded to boot into my freshly installed Archlinux vm and was presented with the LXQt desktop Environment. There are still many things to do for house cleaning, but this felt like success.
 Don't give up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have two 1 TB SSD's on my computer. I have been searching through google for a while now in order to figure out best course of action to utilize this space. Most of the posts I have encountered center around installing on a system with one small root SSD and one bigger home one which does not apply to me. The second SSD can be easily formatted and mounted to be used as a storage space for files but then the package manager does not install packages there when home partition gets full.
 What I planned to do was that one SSD would have boot, swap, root ,home as usual while the other SSD also being included in /home so that it is utilized by the package manager. I don't exactly know if this is possible. In any case, can anyone point me into the right direction to look at to figure it out?
 TL;DR my main goal is that I want my OS to use both drives to install packages, both home partition of the 1st drive and the whole of 2nd drive, kinda like treating it as one.

 I tried to login with the supplied credentials & am taken to a terminal so I tried start & startx neither boots up a GUI.
 I admittedly don't know very much about Linux & was going to use this to see what I thought of it since I've heard it's 1 of the common distros becoming pretty popular similar to Manjaro, Linux Mint, Ubunuto/Kubunutu/Lubunutu etc
 Would appreciate it very much if anyone could tell me what to do to get to a GUI based mode.

 aur/zfs-dkms 2.1.3-1 -> 2.1.4-1 aur/zfs-utils 2.1.3-1 -> 2.1.4-1 
 When I ran the upgrade command it spent a long time upgrading various packages including some of these zfs related things then failed with this error.
 :: installing zfs-utils (2.1.4-1) breaks dependency 'zfs-utils=2.1.3' required by zfs-dkms 
 I had to uninstall zfs-dkms and zfs-utils then reinstall them for it to work. But why did this happen? How can I prevent it from happening on future upgrades?

 The issue I'm facing is that while i do know how to create a swap file on an ext4 system, I'm not quite sure how to do so on a btrfs system with auto snapshot-ting also set up. Simply creating a swap file leads to timeshift not being able to create snapshots, so I have to apparently set up a swap file in a separate sub volume. I frankly don't know how to do this, so any and all help with creating swap like this would be appreciated. 
 Going on a tangent, what do you guys think i should be using? Zram or swap? As i said I have a machine with 8gigs of RAM and occasionally this leads to complete freezes after which i have to force reboot. 
 Thanks for all the replies.

 But here is the tricky thing :
 I would to have a common OS part which does the boot and hold the different packages, and a choice of the workshop to load (either at boot, either later.
 These workshop configurations would only concern the home directory, and the software launched at boot. By the way, I would also like to forbid the user any modification on neither the flash drive, neither the host machine.
 But I would like to myself be able to change these workshop configurations later on without burning again the full drive. 
 How would you do it ?
 ​
 Here are my ideas :
 1 partition for the system, that would remain read-only.
 1 partition for the mods for each workshop.
 The workshop could be changed by logging to a specific user account, and to avoid modification on the drive, a ram disk would be mounted.
 However, the only hybrid UEFI/Bios boot I encountered so far are from live usb iso... And I definitively don't know hos to proceed to add writable partition on such devices...
 ​
 ​
 Any suggestions ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm writing this because I ran out of ideas on how to fix this. This all started when there was that big firmware update, after update my wi-fi wasn't working, because of a bug. I'm using lvm snapshots so I tried to revert it but it was unsuccessful. Somehow I got kernel mismatch, which is weird because I never had problems like that on my other PC. After that I went in live boot and updated system again. It fixed kernel mismatch. And since then 2 out of 3 updates ended in kernel mismatch.
 I already tried going in live boot and updating again, reverting snapshot. In the latest attempt to update I'm 100% sure boot partition was mounted because mount printed /dev/nvme0n1p1 mounted on /boot/EFI (nvme0n1p1 is boot partition). It was a while ago when I was trying to fix this issue and I forgot everything that I tried. I tried searching ArchWiki and forums and noting helped me. I did however discover that when you are updating your system, that your boot partition needs to be mounted and if you unmount it it should be empty. If I unmount my partition it's not empty (stat initramfs-linux.img shows file was indeed copied there at last update).
 When I try to boot I get:
  
[FAILED] failed to start Load Kernel modules.[FAILED] failed to mount /boot/EFI[DEPEND] Dependency failed for Local File System
  
Then I get emergency shell.
 journalctl -xb mentions:
  
/boot/EFI: unknown filesystem type 'vfat'
  
cat /etc/fstab
  
UUID=ZE69-C2EC /boot/EFI vfat rw,realtime, .... , errors=remount-ro 0 2
  
uname -a
  
5.16.10-arch1-1 ...
  
pacman -Q
  
5.17.1.arch1-1
  
Last time I updated I gave up trying to fix it because only kernel downgrade worked. Today I tried to update it again since I hoped it would be fixed by update, like the first time, but that didn't happen.
 I'm also using LVM on Luks if this is important.
 Does anyone have any ideas what else I can try or where else can I look for solution? Anyway thanks for reading.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AMD is one of the behemoths of graphics on PC. Granted, Nvidia is miles ahead in terms of actual sales, but if you want great value for the money and comparable performance, then AMD could be the way to go. Updating graphics drivers should usually be a simple process, but there are certainly better and worse ways to do it.
    
Sometimes taking the default GPU update route can lead to a misbehaving graphics card, so we show you how to update your AMD drivers so that they work properly after the update in bot Windows 10 and 11.
