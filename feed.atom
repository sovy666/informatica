        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not sure where this bug originates: if it's in rsync, zsh, some plugin for zsh or the arch packaging of any of these, but there's a problem with the auto-complete when auto-completing remote paths while rsyncing between my two arch machines. I seems to stem from a recent change in rsync behaviour I think.
 Before you had to prepend \\ to all your escapes when dealing with remote files in rsync, this in order to send the escapes to the remote machine. So if you had a machine machine with a file my file you wanted to copy, you would use rsync -Parch machine:my\\\ file ..
 However now I get an error saying rsync: [sender] link_stat "/home/machine/my\ file" failed: No such file or directory (2), and the way to fix it is to remove the escaped \: rsync -Parch machine:my\ file ..
 Anyone else have this problem? Is there a way to fix this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there! I'm trying to dual boot Windows 10 with Arch on a HP Victus 16 laptop. I have Windows already installed and secure boot disabled, but when booting from the live USB, the whole system crashes and restarts. This happens before the root prompt appears, and the last message that I get to see usually changes. The one I have seen the most has something about the backlight, but I haven't managed to fully read it.
 The laptop has an RTX 3050, which might be the problem. Any suggestions?

 I have an AMD FirePro M6100 that when in arch, I can't seem to get to work but in other distros (Like Manjaro) seem to work fine.
 Under arch, my install doesn't even seem to be detecting it. I even looked through the boot logs to make sure it is at least throwing an error and there is nothing referencing amdgpu or radeon (This is South Island based/GCN 2.0 so it supports amdgpu)
 And yes, Ive read the wiki and can't seem to wrap my head around it (Its instructions seem vaige to me) so if anyone can provide any help; it would be very much appreciated
 Thanks!

 If I have pcmanfm installed my right click works fine on folders and files using the touchpad or a connected mouse but if I use pcmanfm-gtk3 I can no longer right click. The 3 finger middle click still works.
 Both pcmanfm and gtk3 are version 1.3.2-1 and both from the arch community repository and only other packages that change are libfm-gtk2 to libfm-gtk3.
 System is fully updated, running swaywm so maybe a wayland issue? I don't have the full xorg suite installed but do have xorg-xwayland. Tried figuring out if it was a known bug but having trouble navigating the source forge repo.

 So, I do hide unwanted ones by setting NoDisplay=true for their desktop entries. 
 And I have to do it after every update of the package.
 A possible solution is to set these entries' path as NoExtract in pacman.conf. But I don't think that's a viable solution.
 So, I wonder if there's any pacman hook or something, then I set which entries I wanted to hide.

 When I launch Minecraft sound decides to just not work anymore, until I kill pulsaudio. In-game sound works just fine. My output is line-out.
 Firefox stops playing back videos. Spotify doesn't play back music. VLC goes completely wild, no sound and the video is played back in a separate window next to the main window.
 All the things mentioned work fine before launching Minecraft.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have a touchpad that has 4 buttons, two at the bottom and two at the top, however the two top buttons have some problems that I can't understand. When I click at any of the top buttons, something weird happens to the system and it becomes unusable.
 When I was in Windows, this problem was easily fixed by disabling the touchpad and using a mouse instead. It's not the case in linux, since the driver is not working well. When I disable the touchpad, it only disables the bottom buttons. The first time I encountered this problem was in linux mint, i thought it was a software problem, but when i jumped to windows(dual boot), the problem was there too.
 NOTE: im not a pro linux user

I work with C++ so I frequently need to compile a lot of source code, and several ultrabooks I tried it just quickly overheated, throttled, and sometimes even kernel panicked. I tried various thermal control packages recommended by the wiki but they don't help. I finally ended up just using a razer gaming laptop (I figure they are built with better thermals), but while it works, I don't need the Nvidia GPU or the Optimus feature at all, and often they just introduce minor nuisances due to poor Linux support. And although I got them working now, they still drain a lot of battery life, which is not ideal.
 What would you recommend for my situation? Does the new framework laptop have good thermal profile?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings
 Previously I have used Archlinux in a virtual machine with no problems whatsoever, but when I made an install on bare metal I had a problem with pipewire. I have installed pipewire, pipewire-pulse and pipewire-alsa; but it doesn't seem to output any audio. I have check with alsautils that it is not muted, pavucontrol is detecting everything.
 The info that I get when I enter pactl is this:
 Server String: /run/user/1000/pulse/native
 Library Protocol Version: 35
 Server Protocol Version: 35
 Is Local: yes
 Client Index: 320
 Tile Size: 65472
 User Name: jonathan
 Host Name: archjoni
 Server Name: PulseAudio (on PipeWire 0.3.52)
 Server Version: 15.0.0
 Default Sample Specification: float32le 2ch 48000Hz
 Default Channel Map: front-left,front-right
 Default Sink: auto_null
 Default Source: u/DEFAULT_SOURCE@
 Cookie: e6d1:e351
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 When I check their status with systemctl they don't show any error. 
 One thing I've found after reading the wiki is about pipewire-pulse and its config. When I enter to /etc/pipewire all I have are empty directories such as pipewire.conf.d or pipewire-pulse.conf.d. I don't really know how to proceed with the commands that show the archwiki after that.
 I apologize for any mistakes I have made.

However when I run sudo pacman -S polybar, it does not accept my password. I have used the passwd function to reset the password, and can log into the account normally, but it just does not work for sudo. I have also verified the account in question is on the sudoer list, so I don't know what to do from here. Right now I'm just stuck installing packages as root, which I don't really want to be doing.

 I'm having a really hard time grasping both the official documentation and the Arch Linux wiki. Feeling really thick right now.. I went back to pipewire-media-session but a part of me feels icky doing that seeing as wireplumber is the recommended path forward according to the wiki...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings, I am running arch Linux on my xiaomi pro laptop. It's been running great until very recently. I've been getting the strangest issue where all of sudden my system forgets it's a system? If I have back open and try to run a command it will return:
 bash: ls: command not found
 And even though I can still use mouse and keyboard, I cannot call dmenu or summon a new terminal or anything. I am scratching my head. Checking my logs I don't see anything obvious, though I'm not sure where to look as I have no idea what's going on?
 I've been trying to get a game to run in steam using different versions of proton, and wound up installing pipx and then installing protontricks. I still haven't gotten the game to work, and I'm not sure if it's related. But it's driving me nuts.
 And last night I was watching a video in vlc and it froze, the whole computer was unresponsive, for about 30 seconds, then it just went back to normal. This happened twice more. 
 I'm having some issues with the keyboard, so I'm wondering if it's a software problem or not? If it's hardware, how would I check? I'm really at a loss here.

If I need to supply any log files just tell me and I will immediately send them over.
 EDIT: I was able to fix my issue by replacing the nvidia-dkms back to nvidia from pacman.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WhatsApp stickers are a great way of zazzing up your chats, adding plenty of color, quips and cartoon faces to your conversations. WhatsApp doesn’t have an incedible selection of emojis by default, but go a couple of taps further, and you can find a whole world of sticker packs that you can download to add hundreds of emojis and images to your WhatsApp sticker collection.
    
You can also go further afield in search of sticker packs, but there are many bad ones out there, with some even trying to rope you into subscriptions (don’t do it!), so here we’ve rounded up the best WhatsApp sticker packs for you to safely use.

Specifically what i'm trying to do is make the output of "pacman -Ss" have a different color or bold the version numbers or something like that so the package name itself could be highlighted and just make the text more human readable. 
 Currently I'm using zsh with pl10k but I'm not super aware of how to find different modifiers for that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there. I recently decided to switch to latest kernel instead of lts kernel. I installed linux and linux-headers. Then I uninstalled linux-lts and linux-lts-headers. But I forgot to update grub config and rebooted my computer. Grub said me there is no linux-lts as expected.
 I edited the boot entry by pressing "C" key because my grub theme says press "C" to edit entry.
 The entry was like 
 load\_video set gfxpayload=keep insmod gzio insmod part\_gpt insmod fat search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root EAB5-2070 echo 'Loading Linux linux-lts ...' linux /vmlinuz-linux-lts root=UUID=aa92f198-68cf-45a1-a788-0fe6caca5289 rw rootflags=subvol=@ rootfstype=btrfs loglevel=3 quiet echo 'Loading initial ramdisk ...' initrd /amd-ucode.img /initramfs-linux-lts-fallback.img 
 I just deleted "-lts" parts from the code and I'd able to boot my linux. Then I update grub config by typing:
 # grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
 I want to shared my experience because If someone do the same, This post may be helpful. So I publish that as "Support | Solved".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Beat the Amazon Prime Days rush and take advantage of this fantastic deal now. Get a Toshiba 65″ Class M550 Smart Fire TV for half off. That’s 4K, Dolby Vision HDR, Alexa, and no remote needed, all for under $500.
    
Don’t even think this smart TV has this type of discount because it’s old, as it was just released in December. You’ll get a wide color gamut for a more colorful and vibrant picture. Dolby Vision HDR and HDR10+ add to the viewing experience even more, as does the Regza Engine 4K.
    
The backlight panel has a full array of local dimming, which separates the LEDs into more controlled, smaller areas for the TV to have more control over where it adds more light. Add to that the 480 Motion Rate panel that provides smooth, fluid movement, even in gaming and the fastest action movies.
   
 
   
The Toshiba 65″ Class M550 Smart Fire TV includes Alexa for hands-free TV control. You don’t even need a remote to speak into. Just... Read more]]></summary>

 Been trying to install and configure Nvidia drivers following this guide: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA_Optimus#Use_NVIDIA_graphics_only
 I've already installed nvidia-lts and xorg-xrandr.
 I've also created 10-nvidia-drm-outputclass.conf as shown on the Wiki, the only difference being that I changed Driver to "nvidia-lts", since I'm using linux-lts.
 ~ xrandr --listmonitors Monitors: 1 0: +eDP-1 1600/344x900/193+0+0 eDP-1 
 the command above just outputs my integrated display, but I do have an HDMI connected to my laptop.
 I'm using lightdm with this display setup script:
 ​
 #!/bin/sh intern=eDP-1 extern=HDMI-0 if xrandr | grep "$extern disconnected"; then xrandr --output "$extern" --off --output "$intern" --primary --mode 1600x900 --pos 0x180 --rotate normal --brightness 0.65 else xrandr --output "$intern" --mode 1600x900 --pos 0x1800 --rotate normal --brightness 0.65 --output "$extern" --primary --right-of "$intern" --mode 2560x1080 --pos 1600x0 --rotate normal fi 
 ​
 My goal is to make xrandr detect my HDMI connection so I can use my external monitor but it looks like my Nvidia driver isn't initializing properly:
 sudo nvidia-xconfig WARNING: Unable to locate/open X configuration file. ERROR: Unable to find any GPUs in the system. New X configuration file written to '/etc/X11/xorg.conf' 
 Although it says it was unable to find any GPU, lspci lists it:
 ~ lspci | grep VGA 00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation CoffeeLake-H GT2 [UHD Graphics 630] 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GP107M [GeForce GTX 1050 Mobile] (rev a1) 
 My MODULES array in /etc/mkinitcpio.conf is empty, but I'm not sure if I need to add anything there...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the advent of Metaverse, the real estate market has been making a crucial shift. That’s because you can now buy digital pieces of land in the virtual world, and doing so holds a surprising amount of value. 
    
This acquired land is actually a NFT that belongs to you, proving your ownership as each one is unique and has a different digital signature. But what makes it such a big deal, and how can you get your own piece of land in the Metaverse? These are the questions we will be answering in this article.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nel caso dei supporti di memorizzazione, la formattazione è quella particolare procedura che permette di predisporre il supporto che accoglierà i dati: si pensi a un hard disk, un'unità SSD, una chiavetta USB, una scheda SD o un qualunque altro supporto di memorizzazione esterno.Formattare significa quindi preparare un supporto di memorizzazione per renderlo idoneo all'archiviazione di dati. A stretto rigore, un'unità viene dapprima inizializzata ovvero predisposta a livello logico con la creazione di una o più partizioni secondo un preciso schema di partizionamento (GPT o MBR).Le partizioni di hard disk, SSD e unità rimovibili vengono utilizzate per suddividere i dati. In una partizione, ad esempio, si può installare il sistema operativo mentre l'altra accoglierà i dati.Nel caso di molti sistemi operativi vengono create, sullo stesso supporto, una partizione che si occupa di gestire la procedura di avvio mentre in un'altra vengono salvati i file che fanno funzionare il sistema vero e proprio (e che vengono caricati successivamente).]]></summary>

 I looked at my router (which is a Fritz!Box 7530) but it is reporting no issues. I've also tried with / without my VPN.
