 I use nvidia and I also installed nvidia-dkms.
 Does anyone know why it doesnt work? Idk if i can provide a log.
 Edit: it works now for some weird reason. After rebooting it somehow managed to work? I have no idea why but I guess it magically fixed itself?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi /r/archlinux. I discovered a simple but really great helper package today that I never saw mentioned anywhere, and thought I'd share: makepkg-meta.
 It allows you to easily create and update meta packages, i.e. packages whose sole job it is to pull in other dependencies. My use case is cleaner management of optional dependencies. 
 With those, the question is always whether you install them --asdeps or --asexplicit. In the former case, they may get removed accidentally, in the latter case I often forget to remove them when uninstalling the depending package, so they just clutter the system ("Hmm, do I still need that? Better leave it alone.").
 Instead, create a meta package that depends on the package and all your chosen optional dependencies.
 E.g. to install zim with optional gnuplot and xdot, run
 makepkg-meta zim-meta -a zim -a gnuplot -a xdot 
 which will create and install (*) a meta package zim-meta with the specified dependencies. All packages will be kept installed as long as it's there, and if you run pacman -Rsc zim, it gets removed automatically, taking the optional deps with it if needed.
 Adding more dependencies later can be done by a similar call (-a -> add). To remove a dependency, use
 makepkg-meta zim-meta -r xdot 
 This will update the meta package, making xdot obsolete. Then, uninstall it via pacman -Rsc xdot or even
 pacman -Qdttq | sudo pacman -Rsc - 
 to remove all orphan packages (since they're all really obsolete now that you know this trick).
 (*): AUR packages need to be installed (--asdeps) first, the tool uses pacman internally, so it can't resolve them. Or patch the script to use your AUR helper of choice.

I shrunk my windows volume by 200GB, deleted my ubuntu partition completely, and made two partitions that i didnt get the chance to mount yet of around 250GB each. I rebooted, now i can't access my system. Arch goes into some sort of recovery mode. I can see that my files are in /home/ at least.
 windows gives me the error cannot mount boot disk.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strumenti come VirusTotal e Hybrid Analysis sono universalmente apprezzati e si rivelano eccellenti alleati nella lotta contro i malware, compresi quelli di nuova concezione.I due servizi online utilizzano un approccio diverso: come abbiamo spiegato nella guida su VirusTotal questo strumento si occupa di sottoporre contemporaneamente a scansione antimalware uno stesso file usando decine di motori di produttori differenti.Hybrid Analysis, invece, esegue o apre il file in una macchina virtuale, un po’ come farebbe l'utente: in questo modo è possibile saggiare il comportamento di qualsiasi file e ottenere un riscontro sulle modifiche applicate al sistema.Questo strumento di analisi è particolarmente sicuro perché tutte le modifiche sono effettuate su un sistema virtuale eseguito sull'infrastruttura cloud di CrowdStrike (mentre VirusTotal è di proprietà di Google).]]></summary>

Lo studio in questione dal titolo Your Echos are Heard è consultabile a questo indirizzo.Sia la società di Jeff Bezos che ben 41 partner pubblicitari utilizzerebbero i dati raccolti dai dispositivi Amazon Echo per creare profili degli utenti e servire annunci 'ad hoc'.

A spiegarlo ci hanno pensato i tecnici di TSMC, azienda taiwanese che realizza i SoC per conto di Apple.Gli ingegneri di TSMC chiariscono che UltraFusion è un'interconnessione diretta tra chip chiamata InFO (Integrated Fan-Out) in gergo tecnico. Nell'elettronica digitale il fan-out rappresenta il numero di porte logiche che possono essere collegate all'uscita di una porta logica.Nel caso del SoC M1 Ultra TSMC ha utilizzato la tecnica InFO_LI (InFO con interconnessione locale) e un Redistribution Layer (RDL).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UPDATE: solved by using gdm instead of sddm.
 Hello, i've made a family PC but i have a small issue:
 since this PC will be used by at least 3 different people and each of them prefer a different desktop environment (one wants KDE, another wants cutefish and another wants gnome) i've installed all of them and they simply choose their user and DE at SDDM login.
 Which is fine, BUT i wanted to know if there's a way to make this switch "automatic" for each user.
 So for example if at the login screen User1 decides to login GNOME is automatically selected as their DE, while when User2 login at the SDDM login screen KDE is automatically selected whitout them needing to manually selecting it in the menu' at the bottom.
 It is a minor inconvenience that can be avoided by selecting the DE at login like we always did, but it would be nice if that could be done automatically.
 Is this possible with some scripts/config or by using a different login manager?
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have four encrypted hard drives, which I mount using systemd.automount and keyfiles. It takes a little while to prepare the devices on boot, which is fine. But when I open my file manager (Krusader) systemd mounts all drives at once and it takes around 30 seconds to open the file manager. I already changed mount points from /home to /mnt but it didn't change anything.
 I know that the drives have to be opened and mounted at some point eventually, but is there a good way to do this one by one when I actually need one of those drives and not all at once? The way it is now I could just normally mount them on boot instead.

 Thank you everyone. What I finally did to fix it was simply setting a static IP in the Gnome network settings, reboot, then set it back to Automatic.
 That's one way to waste an afternoon.
 Suddenly my laptop can't connect to my network anymore. I've spent 2 hours now trying to figure this out with no luck.
 ping returns connect: Network is unreachable
 I'm using NetworkManager. Wired connection, though wireless doesn't work either.
 Everything was fine before I went to bed and now this.
 Please ask what info you need.
 I'm so close to reinstalling.

L'azienda, che eseguirà i lavori, è stata l'unica a partecipare alla gara mentre la progettazione sarà affidata a EDS Infrastrutture.La copertura in banda ultralarga affidata ad Elettra TLC riguarderà le isole dell'Arcipelago toscano, del bacino di Ustica, delle Pelagie, delle Ponziane, dell'Asinara, delle Egadi, Sulcitane e Tremiti. Prevista la posa di cavi sottomarini in fibra ottica, attività nella quale Elettra TLC è specializzata.Non è dato sapere, invece, l'esito della gara per i 15 lotti nel resto d'Italia: fonti vicine alla società in-house del Ministero dello Sviluppo Economico fanno riferimento alla presentazione di offerte provenienti solo da Open Fiber e FiberCop.Ad oggi non ci sono comunicazioni ufficiali sull'esito della procedura conclusasi il 31 marzo scorso.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I've installed Arch at least 2 dozen times now in VMs and a couple times on real machines. Never had any issues.
 But today and last night, I am having a heck of a time booting into a freshly installed VM using EFI. I installed everything and it all configured nicely for me. I even rebooted and it loaded refind and booted me into the command prompt just fine. I shut it down with the shutdown now command, powered it back up again and I keep getting what you see here. Does anyone know how to fix this?
 I know I've ran Arch in an EFI in Proxmox before. I can't seem to figure out why this isn't working. I tried doing a mkinitcpio -p linux and when I rebooted the first time it finally logged me in... Now when I reboot it just goes to a EFI shell after I get that error screen.

 I am new to arch and linux in general and have some troubles with it. The things that bug me the most are that it feels really laggy on my 144hz monitor. It all feels like its running at 60fps. I've tried the vsync test online but something is still off. Also something happened to the font. It is not as smooth as before.
 I tried to reinstall the nvidia drivers with:
 pacman -S nvdia-lts
 but this didn't seem to work so I decided to turn to reddit.

Perhaps you are doing some research and you don’t want to risk the videos you are using as reference becoming unavailable. Maybe you want to keep all the videos in one place so that you can go through them all without searching or waiting. 
    
In another scenario, for example, you uploaded a video to a streaming site and no longer have the original but would like to recover it. If you have it saved offline, at least you can have a backup of it. Perhaps you are going away somewhere remote with no Wi-Fi for a month. You can line up a bunch of videos to keep you entertained. This review takes a look at EaseUS Video Downloader to see how it could help you out in these scenarios.

While I was then researching how to sort that out my power went out and the desktop PC I was installing on powered down. Now when i attempt to boot it I get absolutely nothing except a black screen and a blinking line similar to a command line. No grub nothing. If I try to press any keys nothing happens and an error sound is emitted. No mouse either. I am not sure what to do please help.
 edit: i can’t just start again because there is no boot menu. the pc literally turns on and it’s just a black screen with a line cursor that doesn’t let me type or do anything.

Installare ed eseguire Ubuntu in Windows
 Grazie alle tante soluzioni per la virtualizzazione delle quali possiamo disporre oggi, è molto semplice installare ed eseguire Ubuntu in Windows.
Installazione di Ubuntu come macchina virtuale in Windows
 Per installare Ubuntu in Windows si possono utilizzare varie soluzioni per la virtualizzazione ma Microsoft Hyper-V risulta immediatamente fruibile dagli utenti di tutte le edizioni di Windows 10 e 11.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I've got a relatively new arch install and am not seeing any fan speeds for my nvidia GPU showing in lm-sensors. I ran sensors-detect and said yes to everything, which seems to have gotten the GPU temp to show up, but I can't seem to get output for fan speeds. I'm assuming there's some kernel module I've forgotten to load or something.
 I can see the fan speed with nvidia-smi, and set the speed with nvidia-settings, but they don't show up in lm-sensors.
 My end goal is to get the fans added to my plasma-systemmonitor layout, but the only sensors that show up as options to add to my graph are ones found with lm-sensors. And I can't figure out how to make a custom sensor for plasma-systemmonitor that can be imported into the list of available sensors - If I could, I could just make a simple script to pull fanspeed with nvidia-settings every second.
 Any idea how to get the GPU fan sensors to show up?
