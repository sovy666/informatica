If you’re looking for another great Raspberry Pi project, I urge you to try this one. This tutorial shows you how to turn your Raspberry PI into a video conferencing station.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been trying to learn more about using and manipulating Linux since getting a Steam Deck. So before trying this I had practically no knowledge of Linux usage except what sudo meant. My first challenge to myself was to get GBStudio v.3.0.3 to run on the deck so I can create on the go. 
 From the itch.io link, I can get an Ubuntu/Debian package, or a Fedora/Red Hat package. I went with the .deb package because I saw more info online for it.
 I decided the easiest way to do all this was with AUR (Arch User Repository). And then using YAY (Yet Another Yogurt). Which is a Pacman wrapper and AUR helper.
 This would supposedly allow me to wrap the .deb package into something more palatable for the Steam Deck to install.
 Starting by allowing the Decks read only to be written. I’m iffy on that…]]></summary>

 Initially, it also gave me a lot of mounting errors on boot even though my fstab seemed perfectly fine. Still, I deleted it and generated a new one with genfstab, and then it started. This is where I'm at. (Initially, I think it failed to mount /boot and also said something about dependencies failing for the local file system)
 I'm not exactly sure what I did that might've caused all of this. My uptime was ~5 days, so there are a lot of things that I could've done
 From a chroot, I've tried reinstalling the kernel and downgrading it, neither of which helped

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone, Sorry if this isn't exactly the right spot, but I just need some pointers more than a concrete solution. I've got both KDE 5.24 and GNOME 42 installed on my Arch system, largely because of GNOME's more mature Wayland implementation. All arch packages are up to date, systemd is version 251, and I'm using the latest ZEN kernel, 5.17.9.
 These DE's seem to play poorly together, with GNOME the more affected party. Perhaps notably, my login/startup is SDDM, not GDM, since I had installed KDE first.
 In both
 opening a terminal gives the message:
 discover_other_daemon: 1% 
 which I think is the clue that things are duplicated.
 On GNOME: The KDE wallet system always opens at startup, and the akonadi server processes all run in the background. Further, the KDE demon runs in the background; if I log out or shutdown, it warns me that I will also log out... myself, but that's presumably my username "logged in" on a KDE session.
 Theming on GNOME seems to be seriously impacted, in that only my legacy app theme -- the one I can set in KDE, fwiw -- respected, whereas all other GTK apps, including all those that are part of GNOME itself, completely ignoring my theming, darkmode preferences, etc. Changing config files doesn't seem to do anything, nor does completely deleting them, even.
 Any Ideas about what to try? I think if I can find a way to make KDE services and daemons only launch if a KDE desktop session is started by me would probably solve all the troubles, though I don't know what troubles that might cause for KDE.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to learn more about Arch Linux and packages. Is there a way to grab the description from the pacman repos for all of my installed packages? I already did verbose for pacman but that just makes it into a list and shows the version before and after update.
 Example, today there was an update for knewstuff. I had no idea what the hell that was. Looking on the pacman repo it says "Support for downloading application assets from the network".
 https://archlinux.org/packages/?sort=&q=knewstuff&maintainer=&flagged=
 Basically I want to make a spreadsheet with all of my installed packages and the pacman description beside each package so I can continue learning.
 Thanks fellow Archers.

 I'm currently using the modesetting driver, no xf86-video packages are installed and my nvidia card is blacklisted in modprobe.
 P.S. The screen have a resolution of 2880x1800 90Hz, 14".
 Someone had this issue before?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I switched to Wayland from X11 on gnome because I was having stuttery window movement with two different refresh rate screens. This is fixed on Wayland but it seems like there is no way for me to adjust GPU fan speed. I think my GPU has a broken fan controller or something because it makes a grinding noise over and over when starting up and at certain speeds (no clue how hard this would be to fix). so I usually set the fans to a higher speed.
 I saw a post here with someone using green with envy in a separate/parallel TTY. If I launch it the gui does actually launch into Wayland but it is still unable to control the fans. 
 Would appreciate any help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[L'ultima parte dell'anno si preannuncia molto impegnativa per Intel che potrebbe presentare sia i processori Raptor Lake, i Core di tredicesima generazione, sia i Sapphire Rapids con l'obiettivo, in questo caso, di recuperare il terreno perso in campo professionale, HEDT (High-End Desktop) e server dopo l'avanzata degli AMD EPYC.I modelli più prestazionali degli Intel Core Raptor Lake potrebbero essere presentati a ottobre prossimo insieme con il chipset Z790.La società guidata da Pat Gelsinger starebbe lavorando per incentivare l'arrivo sul mercato di nuove schede madri della serie 700: quelle con chipset H770 e B760 verrebbero rese disponibili il prossimo anno.Un programma simile è stato adottato per la gamma Intel Core di dodicesima generazione: molto probabile che le CPU della serie K saranno tra le prime a essere presentate.Per quanto riguarda i Sapphire Rapids non è dato sapere quale nome commerciale assumeranno ma in linea di principio dovrebbero essere processori appartenenti alla gamma Xeon e potrebbero sfidare i Threadripper PRO della rivale AMD.Nella nostra guida al miglior processore Intel e AMD ci siamo ampiamente soffermati sulle differenze tra le CPU proposte dalle due aziende per i vari segmenti di mercato.AMD è già pronta con la sua offerta Ryzen 7000 presentata in occasione del Computex 2022: l'avvio delle vendite, insieme con le motherboard compatibili, potrebbe avvenire già a fine agosto.Non è esclusa una presentazione estiva, a luglio, per massimizzare gli sforzi e giocare d'anticipo rispetto a Intel e ai suoi Core di tredicesima generazione..]]></summary>

Possono essere segretamente aggiunte all'interno dei videogiochi, nei programmi per PC, nelle applicazioni per i dispositivi mobili ma anche nelle applicazioni Web. Si presentano come ingegnosi messaggi, piccoli giochi, presentazioni, citazioni goliardiche.Nei prodotti dell'azienda di Mountain View sono presenti tanti giochi Google nascosti: alcuni di essi vengono inseriti come parte integrante dei doodle ovvero i loghi animati che vengono pubblicati nella pagina del motore di ricerca durante occasioni speciali ed eventi.I doodle interattivi avviano un gioco o comunque richiedono all'utente qualche tipo di intervento: talvolta vengono mostrati brevi video, a volte si ha a che fare con dei veri e propri videogiochi, altre volte con delle avventure grafiche.Qualche esempio? Il gioco dei nani da giardino, il gioco di Halloween che può essere addirittura utilizzato per organizzare partite in multiplayer, il gioco del basket, il gioco del calcio Google, quello più recente dedicato ai Giochi Olimpici 2020-2021.Sono solo alcuni esempi nei quali è impossibile imbattersi scorrendo l'archivio dei doodle.
Dove trovare i giochi Google nascosti nel motore di ricerca
 Il motore di ricerca Google consente di accedere direttamente ad un ampio ventaglio di giochi pronti per l'uso.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I found out about the --batchinstall option to yay 
  
When building and installing AUR packages instead of installing each package after building, queue each package for install. Then once either all packages are built or a package in the build queue is needed as a dependency to build another package, install all the packages in the install queue.
  
It solves some issues I get when trying to do zfs upgrades so I wanted to add it to my yay config file so it always does a batch install. Is there any problem that come could up if I always use it? It seems like a good option but it's not the default so there could be some downside to it so is there a time you wouldn't want to add --batchinstall?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I must say, it feels pretty damn good that after a few days of failed attempts, I finally managed to successfully install Arch using just the terminal.
 I got myself most of the way through with the wiki. It seems to involve a lot of clicking links to read referencing articles towards the end. Google led me to a few articles that were really helpful and some that weren't. Either they skimed over the parts I needed further clarification on or they just didnt cover it at all.
 The part I really struggled on was installing a bootloader. I tried grub my first few tries and had forgot to mount the boot partition to /boot/EFI (I'm installing as practice for my bare metal PC, which uses UEFI). I had only mounted it to /boot. So I kept getting errors I just couldn't figure out.
 I switched over and tried installing systemd-boot. I think I might've been making the same mistake again as I just couldn't seem to get systemd-boot to work either. I tried with systemd-boot twice before I gave up. 
 I woke up this morning and read this super handy how-to from It's FOSS (https://itsfoss.com/install-arch-linux/) that walked me through the grub install. I felt like I understood where I went wrong so I booted up a VM and started another attempt. I got to the bootloader part, followed the article to the letter, exit chroot and reboot. I swear I did a little prayer as it was rebooting. The second I saw that grub menu, I almost jumped!
 Anyway, sorry for the long and pretty pointless post 😂🤣 Just celebrating a moment!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Il primo e unico aggiornamento dell'anno destinato alla più recente versione del sistema operativo Microsoft si chiama Windows 11 22H2 (Sun Valley 2).Oggi sappiamo che con il rilascio della build 22621, nuova versione di anteprima di Windows 11, Microsoft ha completato il percorso per la distribuzione della release RTM.Si chiama RTM (Release to Manufacturing) la versione di qualunque sistema operativo candidata alla distribuzione pubblica: Microsoft si riserva di correggere eventuali bug che dovessero emergere nel corso delle prossime settimane ma Windows 11 build 2261 è di fatto la versione RTM di Windows 11 22H2.Al momento non c'è ancora una data fissata per la distribuzione di Windows 11 22H2 in versione finale ma si parla di ottobre prossimo.Per evitare i bug della prima versione di Windows 11 rilasciata il 5 ottobre 2021 in molti hanno preferito ritardare l'aggiornamento e come spesso accade il rilascio del primo feature update: in questo caso Windows 11 22H2 sarà per molti un'occasione per iniziare a valutare la migrazione da Windows 10.Windows 11 22H2, tra l'altro, pur non essendo un semplice Service Pack sarà un aggiornamento che introdurrà un numero limitato di nuove caratteristiche concentrandosi piuttosto sul miglioramento della stabilità del sistema.
Le principali novità di Windows 11 21H2
 Concentriamoci sulle novità più importanti che Microsoft si accinge a introdurre con Windows 11 21H2 e che gli interessati possono provare in anteprima installando l'ultima versione di Windows 11 sui sistemi che non si usano per scopi produttivi.Le funzionalità che si trovano nella build 22621 sono infatti esattamente quelle che si troveranno in Windows 11 22H2.1) Miglioramenti sul menu Start.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read a lot about each of these kernels individually, so I know what they each do in detail, but how do they actually compare in the real world? 
 In my case, I'm using sway (Wayland) on an Intel system and don't do any gaming - just browsing and some productivity in the form of coding. I've actually been using the hardened kernel currently. I always felt like my system was a little... sluggish, laggy-ish... hard to put into words, as such I stumbled on things like different kernels and the ALHP repos.
 So my questions are:
  
1) Will I get a noticeable difference in performance (not necessarily raw numbers, but responsiveness and such) by using either one of these kernels for what I do with my system?
 
2) Between xanmod, tkg, lqx and zen -- which one would probably be the best one for me to use, considering what I use my system for?
 
 I also plan on using the ALHP repos in addition to a new kernel:
  
3) Is there anything for me to consider in regards to my kernel choice considering I want to use the AHLP repos? They should just work, right?
  
I'm currently using the hardenend kernel, as such I wonder:
  
4) I know how hardened compares to the regular kernel, but how do any of these other kernels compare to the hardened one in terms of security? Are they generally less or more secure than the regular kernel?

Cosa sono eMMC e UFS
 Le memorie eMMC (Embedded MultiMediaCard) e UFS (Universal Flash Storage) hanno diverse cose in comune con gli SSD: in tutti i casi vengono utilizzati chip di memoria flash NAND che non richiedono alimentazione per conservare i dati.Nel caso delle memorie eMMC l'aggettivo embedded si riferisce al fatto che la memoria è saldata direttamente sul circuito integrato presente all'interno del dispositivo, ad esempio sulla scheda madre.Lo storage eMMC veniva principalmente utilizzato negli smartphone così come su alcuni tablet e convertibili economici. È utilizzato ancora oggi sui prodotti a più basso costo perché in quelli più performanti si utilizzano memorie UFS, decisamente più performanti.Sia eMMC che UFS sono standard che sono maturati nel corso del tempo tanto che ne sono state via via rilasciate più versioni.]]></summary>

The Hasty Remote Learning Plans
    
If you go back two years to the beginning of the pandemic, everyone was stressed, and no one knew what to do. Schools were empty, but children couldn’t be kept out of school indefinitely. Governments quickly set up plans to teach students remotely. Children would learn on their home computers, and teachers would educate in the same manner.

'Sotto la scocca' cuore pulsante del dispositivo è un SoC Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 con GPU Adreno 730 al quale sono affiancati 8 GB di memoria RAM e 256 GB di storage interno UFS 3.1.Per quanto riguarda la connettività il nuovo Honor Magic 4 Pro assicura supporto 5G, WiFi 6 e integra ovviamente un chip NFC per gestire i pagamenti contactless o per altre esigenze.]]></summary>

It works sometimes, and doesn’t other times. Sometimes, only one of the AirPods’ tap controls work. For example, I have my left AirPod to be the PlayPause control and my right AirPod to be skip to the next in the list. Sometimes, only the pause function of the left AirPod works. The Play function rarely ever works. The next function sometimes works in VLC but doesn’t in other players. Same with the left AirPod’s control. I have them mapped to their appropriate functions in KDE shortcuts.
 So I was wondering if anyone has gotten their AirPods’ tap controls working reliably throughout the operating system?

Sappiamo che lo sviluppo del dispositivo potrebbe essere cominciato già un paio di anni fa, che utilizza - come accennato nell'introduzione - l'interfaccia HDMI e che può essere quindi collegato a qualunque monitor e televisore. Gli appassionati di gaming potranno utilizzare i loro videogiochi preferiti senza bisogno di una console.Keystone potrebbe utilizzare un sistema operativo Windows o Xbox ridotto: il nome Keystone è infatti comparso in un elenco di piattaforme Microsoft non basate sull'utilizzo di Android.L'adozione di un sistema basato su Windows anziché su Android consentirebbe a Microsoft di offrire le proprie app per lo streaming multimediale come 'Film e TV' anche se la scelta del robottino verde sarebbe forse più ovvia e naturale.]]></summary>

In a broad sense, Windows and macOS aren’t that different. Most things work more or less the same and are intuitive. However, there are a few things to know about being a daily Windows user that can make the transition a lot smoother, as we shall see below.

 I need a general purpose os that's private and secure that i can install painlessly software i need.
 i would pick fedora which seems nice. But i was already disappointed that i had to use rpmfusion to get vlc.
 With arch it seems natural to use the Aur and its not an afterthought.
 But that would be it. I dont think i could totally debug linux, i can look at errors and then install missing libraries.
 But i dont know how everything works. Im looking for a good host os with nice privacy though and lots of software, arch seems like the best out of the linux world.
 Opinions?

 I'm not well-versed in scripting but it seems to me that the 'if' command and 'then' statement are standard bash commands used in many scripts. I use the Fish shell and that runs just fine but I'm puzzled about this silly error. Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title says, I'm attempting to move over to Wayland finally. Most things are working well on my laptop (Intel 4th gen with iGPU graphics) so far, except for Steam and Discord. My compositor is dwl, hopefully that isn't the issue.
  
Steam
 I know Steam isn't Wayland-native, and needs to run through Xwayland. When I try to start the application, it gives this error message: ``` Check your DISPLAY environment variable and make sure that you have enabled X. If you are running remotely, make sure that you have a remote connection which will allow an X connection.
 For more information visit https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4050-WOJB-0608 ```
 I've also tried to run it in the command line, setting DISPLAY=:0, but that doesn't make a difference. Xwayland is installed, of course.
  
Discord
 As far as I've been able to figure out, Discord should run using these flags: discord --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland
 However, it simply crashes with this error message: ``` Discord 0.0.17 interface 'wl_output' has no event 4 tcmalloc: large alloc 1073741824 bytes == 0x21611af76000 @ 0x5635a7118d65 0x7f658edbb20f
 Failed to get crash dump id. Report Id: 1c94989d-fb11-45
 Failed to get crash dump id. Report Id: 9d605c7d-0ff2-40 zsh: illegal hardware instruction (core dumped) discord --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland
 ```
 As far as Xwayland goes, I can't seem to get anything to run with it. Not even xclock.
 I figure I must be doing something wrong, but I'm not sure what. I haven't been able to find anything helpful in the Wiki either, unfortunately.

 Windows games on my system no longer work. All my games on protondb are gold and platinum but only Gary’s Mod actually runs.

 •Intel CPU
 •FS System: ext4
 Things I’ve tried:
 •Rebooting 
 •Uninstalling and Reinstalling Steam (Runtime)
 •Uninstalling and Reinstalling all my Steam Games
 •Reading through the Arch Manuels (nothing worked)
 •Updating and retrying
 •Running every proton version
 •Running steam games through terminal (steam.sh all normal but didn’t show anything related to the game)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I would want to use ClamAV in a total manual mode (update signatures on demand and only stand-alone scanner).
 I think in my case no enabled services are needed (both clamav-freshclam and clamav-daemon), but I can't completely follow the wiki ("With clamav-freshclam service enabled the virus definition are kept recent). 
 If I don't enable the freshclam service I get this error during the update: WARNING: Clamd was NOT notified: Can't connect to clamd through /run/clamav/clamd.ctl: No such file or directory. With this service disable it seems that no errors appear, but I assume that an automatic check for updates is activated.
 Please help me to better understand. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You’ve probably been amassing accessories to build up your gaming experience for some time. Now is the time to get that curved monitor you’ve been considering. You can get an LG Curved UltraWide Monitor for more than $100 off and enjoy a three-sided virtually borderless display with adjustable tilt and height.
    
The 34″ monitor has a 21:9 screen ratio to provide accurate color, contrast, clarity, and detail, even when displaying wide angles. While it’s an obvious choice for gaming, it would also be great for streaming blockbuster movies and your favorite TV shows, editing videos, and just overall creation.
    

    
You’ll get a panoramic view to see everything with a great perspective. With that 3440 x 1440 space on the QYD VA display, you’ll get 33% more space than your standard 1920 x 1080 display. If you’re handling both home life and work, all from one monitor, you’ll have plenty of space to do all that multitasking.
    
But nothing will beat the experience you’ll get when gaming on the... Read more]]></summary>

 I tried installing Arch Linux, on a USB with Qtile, since I wanted to try it out and tested it on my Laptop (ASUS TUF DASH F15 FX51PC). I noticed that the keyboard lighting works out of the box (I haven't even mapped those keys to anything in my qtile config), so will this behaviour be replicated, if I install Arch Linux on the actual hardware? Also, I have windows installed on my Laptop, is this happening because of that? I wanted to ask this, because I have seen many people talk about how backlit keyboards don't work very well out of the box on Arch Linux, and some software like OpenRGB needs to be installed for them to work properly. So could someone please clarify this for me?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a multi monitor setup that I'd like to configure.
 I can do that perfectly fine through a shell script and executing that from my .xinitrc:
 #!/bin/sh # Configures monitors. xrandr --output "DP-4" --mode 1920x1080 --rate 144.00 --right-of "HDMI-0" --primary xrandr --output "HDMI-0" --mode 1920x1080 --rate 74.97 --left-of "DP-4" 
 However, from what I can see from the Arch Wiki, this is not the proper way of configuring things.
 Thus, I'm trying to make the two files /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-monitor.conf and /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia.conf as instructed, but they just don't work and I'm left straching my head as to why. They are as follows:
 10-monitor.conf:
 Section "Monitor" Identifier "DP-4" Modeline "1920x1080_144.00" 452.50 1920 2088 2296 2672 1080 1083 1088 1177 -hsync +vsync Option "Primary" "true" Option "PreferredMode" "1920x1080_144.0" EndSection Section "Monitor" Identifier "HDMI-0" Modeline "1920x1080_75.00" 220.75 1920 2064 2264 2608 1080 1083 1088 1130 -hsync +vsync Option "LeftOf" "DP-4" Option "PreferredMode" "1920x1080_74.97" EndSection 
 20-nvidia.conf:
 Section "Device" Identifier "Device0" Driver "nvidia" VendorName "NVIDIA Corporation" Option "monitor-HDMI-1" "HDMI-1" Option "monitor-DisplayPort-4" "DP-4" EndSection 
 I also have tried renaming 20-nvidia.conf to 05-device.conf as instructed in this article of the Arch Wiki, that also didn't help.
 Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fine aprile 2022 il ricercatore Mor Davidovich ha individuato un metodo per acquisire privilegi SYSTEM su qualunque sistema Windows collegato a un dominio.Davidovich ha spiegato di aver 'assemblato' il codice proveniente da diversi tool preesistenti per sviluppare un'applicazione (KrbRelayUp), pubblicata su GitHub, che conente a un utente di acquistare privilegi che non gli competono.In un altro articolo abbiamo visto le differenze tra i privilegi SYSTEM e i diritti di amministratore in Windows.L'aspetto più rilevante della ricerca condotta da Davidovich è che l'acquisizione dei privilegi SYSTEM sui sistemi utilizzati in ambito aziendale funziona anche con la configurazione predefinita del dominio. L'esperto in un primo tempo ha fatto presente che l'attacco KrbRelayUp non andava in porto nel caso in cui l'amministratore di sistema avesse attivato la firma LDAP su Windows Server.Lunedì scorso Davidovich ha rilasciato una nuova versione del suo tool KrbRelayUp che porta all'ottenimento dei privilegi più elevati anche con firma LDAP abilitata.Pur confermando l'esistenza della problematica, Microsoft si è affrettata a precisare che l'attacco in questione non interessa i clienti che usano istanze di Azure Active Directory.KrbRelayUp può comunque aiutare eventuali aggressori a compromettere macchine virtuali Azure in ambienti Active Directory ibridi in cui i controller di dominio sono sincronizzati con Azure Active Directory.In una pagina di supporto appena pubblicata, Microsoft ha condiviso le metodologie per proteggersi dall'attacco KrbRelayUp.In generale, i tecnici dell'azienda di Redmond suggeriscono di attivare la firma LDAP, Extended Protection for Authentication (EPA) e impostare a 0 l'attributo MS-DS-Machine-Account-Quota.Una dimostrazione dell'attacco è stata pubblicata in questo post su Twitter..]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those who are familiar with the Unix system, you will also be familiar with the cron application that allows you to schedule and automate tasks to run on their own. We even have tutorials that show you how to get started with cron and crontabs. However, cron is not perfect, as it requires your system to be running 24 hours a day. If you have a habit of turning off your computer at night, and a cron job is scheduled in the sleeping hours, the task won’t be executed. Luckily, there are several cron alternatives that can do a better job than cron. Let’s check them out.

Phone and Macbook connects to speakers
 Phone plays an audio, speakers plays the audio.
 Phone stop playing audio, speaker is silent.
 Macbook plays an audio, speakers plays the audio.
 Macbook stop playing audio, speaker is silent.
 Phone plays an audio, speakers plays the audio.
  
Then if I do the same with my personal notebook with Arch and PipeWire with PulseAudio support if I do:
  
Phone and Macbook connects to speakers
 Phone plays an audio, speakers plays the audio.
 Phone stop playing audio, speaker is silent.
 Arch plays an audio, speakers plays the audio.
 Arch stop playing audio, speaker is silent.
 Phone plays an audio, speakers is silent.
 Arch plays an audio, speakers plays the audio.
  
Is like Arch/PipeWire keeps the speaker "busy" as if an audio is being played and not letting other devices stream to it.
 Anyone has any idea what can cause this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[La tendenza tra i produttori di processori è quella di utilizzare sempre di più i chiplet: essi permettono di realizzare sistemi di elaborazione più piccoli ed economici che hanno il vantaggio di garantire una maggiore efficienza energetica.I chiplet, racchiusi in un unico pacchetto (package), consentono anche di utilizzare processi costruttivi diversi consentendo di scalare la potenza di elaborazione in modo molto efficace.Parlando della storia dei processori AMD Ryzen abbiamo visto come l'abbandono del tradizionale approccio monolitico per abbracciare la filosofia MCM (multi-chip module) abbia di fatto decretato il rinnovato successo della società di Sunnyvale.Nel caso di NVidia in tanti ipotizzavano che l'architettura Hopper avrebbe utilizzato un design basato su chiplet. Così non è stato ed è altamente probabile che anche l'azienda di Jen Hsun Huang si metta, essa stessa, sulla scia di AMD.L'utilizzo di interconnessioni performanti tra chiplet è e resterà una sfida cruciale per il futuro.]]></summary>
