        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I am using a 2018 legion y740 laptop and trying to boot arch linux for the first time off an external ssd, but everytime after archinstall when I try to boot, these same lines would pop up and freeze the system. I can't type or do anything.
 I have searched online about this issue and they said to blacklist the driver, which doesn't sound very safe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I'm having a rough day with Arch, and would appreciate quick replies if you know how to fix this.
 To explain previous events, my previously working install spontaneously decided not to boot today. This is the error message I get:
 error: no such partition
 error: you need to load the kernel first.
 error: you need to load the kernel first.
 I chrooted with my Arch usb and found out that I was completely running out of space in my EFI partition, and so (I'm assuming) that an update failed and I didn't have what I needed to actually boot. Again, I have no idea if that's the issue, but I do know there were error messages saying there wasn't enough space so I managed to clear some up.
 I figured I should reinstall the kernel to be safe, since it still wasn't booting at this point, and now I'm getting this error message:
 Error: GDBUS.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown: The name org.freedesktop.PackageKit was not provided by any .service files
 Error: command failed to execute correctly
 How do I go about fixing this? Is there anything else I should be looking for that I'm missing? Thank you so much I'm kinda really desperate so if you help me I'll worship you as a new modern god.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Android devices don’t always allow you to open every file type you download or receive in your email. The same applies to compressing a file or group of files. Depending on what the file is, this may be a big inconvenience. Some file managers let you compress or decompress zip files, but what happens if there is a rar or 7z file you need to open? ZArchiver lets you compress and extract files on Android, even if your file manager won’t.

 Python 3.10 works as usual. I tried a clean installation of python and pip itself from pacman but with any result. LMK if you have any suggestion for this problem. Thanks in advance.
 P. S. I will surely use AUR packages in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have a dual boot MSI with Arch Linux and Windows 11, since a few days back the sound in Arch Linux is not working properly. After I start the laptop I get no audio, I need to go to pulseaudio settings and change the Tiger Lake-H HD Audio Controller profile from "Play HiFi quality Music" (the default option) to "Off" and then back to "Play HiFi quality Music" in order to get my sound back. Even doing this, if I pause something and then play it back the sound is gone again. Do any of you know why is this happening?
 Thank all in advance.
 Edit: Solved it installing pipewire-pulse and uninstalling pulseaudio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For better or worse, WhatsApp is the foremost messaging platform on Android (as much though as I champion Signal at every possible opportunity). With the “Status” feature, it doubles as a kind of mini social-network platform, letting users post a status that expires after a certain amount of time (although you can also make it permanent).
    
These statuses can sometimes be funny clips or memes, and if you want to get your hands on them, there’s a way to do it without asking your friends. Here’s how.

Il contenuto della cartella Windows.old viene automaticamente rimosso trascorsi 10 giorni dall'effettuazione dell'aggiornamento.In un altro articolo abbiamo visto come aumentare il numero di giorni per tornare alla versione precedente di Windows 10 qualora, a scopo cautelativo, si volesse tenere per sé qualche giorno in più per assicurarsi che l'aggiornamento applicato non crei alcun problema.

Nell'esempio in figura, la cartella 'di backup' Windows.old pesa circa 22 GB ma le sue dimensioni possono variare notevolmente a seconda della versione di Windows di partenza e quella di Windows 10 che viene installata.]]></summary>

Also, I just really want to thank everyone who commented, you guys are so kind and I really appreciate it! 
 Hi there,
 Have read the wiki and some forum posts but I'm pretty confused at this stage.
 I have an arch install running on a system 76 oryx pro. I did an update last night and this morning my laptop is failing to boot.
 Plymouth is showing a [FAILED] Failed to start Load Kernel Modules which I believe is due to a mismatch in my installed kernel version. Trouble is, I can't access any sort of terminal to diagnose the problem further.
 I guess this is a super noob question, but where do I go from here? How to I even start diagnosing the problem further? The laptop is just frozen at this stage and I can't access a menu, terminal or anything. All of the advice I'm reading is telling me to check various outputs but I am confused as to how?
 Any advice would be much appreciated.

 As far as I know standby/sleep is different on different systems and I'm a bit confused about it.
 I don't need the system to turn off completely (hibernation), but only half (suspend to RAM?)
 Sorry, I looked at Archwiki and googled, but it seems that everyone is only interested in how to turn it off.

 I had wiped the the UEFI secure boot keys, and cleared my TPM chip in my BIOS.
 Installed arch with an encrypted BTRFS partition then did the following:
 sbctl create-keys, Sbctl enroll-key, Applied to bootx64.efi and systemd.bootx64.efi Reboot and enabled secure boot
 And now all is working and secure boot is enabled...However, is there a way to make any new kernel upgrade that comes through via Pacman -Syu automatically enroll the kernel, or is this already good to go?
 Just want to make sure any new kernel that gets installed does not need to be enrolled manually.
 Also, is there something I should be doing to have the boot partition encrypted? Or this ok with the default encryption I have enabled on the BTRFS volume? 
 If it could be explained in simple to follow replies I would be appreciative ;)

 I have enable Apparmor and set the kernel parameters.
 Everything working well and apparmor has 50 profiles enforced, however I am setting the notifications on denied actions and not sure if it's working.
 To note I have completed the following:
 groupadd -r audit
 gpasswd -a (my username) audit
 Sudo nano /etc/audit/auditd.conf And added : log_group = audit
 Installed python-notify2 and python-psutil
 Created this:
 [Desktop Entry] Type=Application Name=AppArmor Notify Comment=Receive on screen notifications of AppArmor denials TryExec=aa-notify Exec=aa-notify -p -s 1 -w 60 -f /var/log/audit/audit.log StartupNotify=false NoDisplay=true
 However, I can't write the script to ~/.config/autostart/apparmor-notify.desktop because it does not exist.
 I have saved it to ~/.config/autostart-scripts/apparmor-notify.desktop instead.
 When I run: sudo pgrep -ax aa-notify nothing happens
 Is the directory "/.config/autostart-scripts/" wrong? I don't have just "autostart" and can't save the nano script if I list that directory.
 Any help appreciated
 UPDATE: I have the script now saved under autostart and autostart-scripts, but when running "Sudo pgrep -ax aa-notify" it still does nothing. So I can't confirm if it's working.

I have a KDE setup and I use a cli music visualizer called CAVA. I usually put it in background, change Konsole profile and set transparency to 100% but as soon as I open another terminal, the one with transparency gets blurred. So I think the only solution to this is to use another terminal that I would only use for this purpose.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the biggest things in the changelogs for me is that VRR/Freesync/Adaptive Refresh Rate is now enabled straight from the kernel.
 It quotes:
  
While the support for FreeSync video was good enough, it was a temporary solution to improve the user experience with FreeSync monitors. 
 ILinux Kernel 5.18, the FreeSync video mode is enabled by default (changelog). You do not have to do anything from your side to enable it with supported monitors.
  
Before this, VRR was acquirable on all DEs with a display port and a config file on xorg, and it is enabled out the box on Plasma Wayland and Sway Wayland. Gnome Wayland despite this still doesn't support VRR.
 How do these changes to the 5.18 kernel affect the way that VRR is normally enabled currently on DEs? What method does it enable it from the kernel? Do they interact with eachother? I was hoping to see Freesync on Gnome Wayland with 5.18 but those hopes were too high.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s always at least one place in your home where a security camera would come in handy: nursery, front door, your pet’s favorite spot, etc. With the eufy Security Solo IndoorCam C24 currently offered for under $30, you could probably stick one up in every one of those spots.
    
The artificial intelligence in the camera can determine whether it sees a human or pet and will only record at the time of an event. Each event is recorded in 2K clarity or 1080P if using HomeKit. Advanced night vision will allow you to still keep an eye on what’s going on, even in low-light settings.
    

    
You’ll be able to hear every detail from the location of the camera so that you can hear if your baby is crying and needs you or whether the dog is barking to go outside. You can also speak through the camera via built-in two-way audio to calm your baby, tell your dog he’s a good boy, let your kids know dinner is ready, etc. Connect... Read more]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/v45twi/installing_arch_linux_on_vmware_vsphere_70_using/"/>
        <updated>2022-06-03T18:34:44.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a Packer configuration that connects to my VMware vCenter 7.0 host, creates a virtual machine, partitions the disks, installs Arch Linux using the Live CD, configures GRUB to use EFI, and reboots. Whenever the Packer reboots the virtual machine, it just boots up using the Live CD, not the installed version of Arch Linux.
 After some investigation, it turns out that the boot order for the UEFI always has the CDROM before the boot partition. If I manually select the boot partition, the newly installed Arch Linux boots up without issues. 
 So I updated the install script to use efibootmgr to change the boot order. It's updated from the looks of things, but the CDROM still boots. Even when I use it to delete boot entries, it continues to kick the Live CD. When I change the EFI boot order manually in the vSphere client or disable entries, it will boot the installed Arch Linux. 
 When I manually eject the CDROM after the reboot, then reboot it again, it will boot into Arch Linux. 
 This leaves me with two questions: 
  
Has anyone successfully installed Arch Linux on VMware vSphere in an unattended fashion?
 What's the best way to instruct Arch Linux to eject removable media before reboots?
  
A note about (2): I can't eject the disk after installation since the Live CD is still in use.

 I have a bit of an odd storage layout, and I want steam to detect my 500 gb ssd.
 I have a 250GB SSD split up to a few partitions as my system drive and I mounted my other drive under /storage/ssd.
 What should I change so steam can see it?
 Thanks in advance!
 EDIT: I wasn't the owner of /storage, solved

A partire dall'armadio stradale fino all'utenza dell'abbonato (rete secondaria) il collegamento prosegue con il tradizionale doppino telefonico in rame.Nel caso delle connessioni fibra misto rame FTTC (Fiber-to-the-Cabinet) il cavo fibra arriva fino all'armadio in strada ('cabinet') mentre nello schema FTTE (Fiber-to-the-Exchange) la tratta in rame è ancora più lunga.]]></summary>

 Suppose that the installation procedure says something like the following

 Now back to the question.
 In such a case, I don't think I would know why I installed B and C.
 I am now realizing the detrimental effects of having used pacman for almost 5 years without a solid understanding of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I recently got arch linux set up and am trying to teach myself some Python to use with qtile
 I've had a little bit of experience with Python, but I wanted to start fresh using a book I found at the library, and I'm already seeing issues somehow.
 when running a "hello world" script, I get no output, it just goes to the next line-
 print( 'Hello World' )
 ​
 typing this same command into the python interpreter yields the "Hello World" we all know and love, but running it by using these commands shows nothing on screen
 python2 helloworld.py
 python3 helloworld.py
 ​
 I thought maybe it was my terminal alacritty, but I also installed kitty and the same thing happened there. I was thinking about asking the Python community directly but I wasn't sure if this is an issue with my arch install or python itself. I even tried running as root and it also did not work. I have python 3.10 and 2.7 installed.
 ​
 Thanks in advance for the help, and let me know if I should check with the Python community instead!

Tra l'altro le stesse app UWP sono state ufficialmente accantonate per guardare a Windows App SDK (Project Reunion), kit di sviluppo che torna a strizzare l'occhio agli storici programmi Win32.Così, come abbiamo visto, Microsoft Store è diventato uno strumento pronto ad accogliere anche applicazioni Win32, .NET, Xamarin, Electron, React Native, Java e Progressive Web Apps (PWA), sia in Windows 10 che in Windows 11.Insieme all'arrivo delle applicazioni Win32, nel corso dell'ultimo anno la società di Redmond ha posto in campo diverse novità per rendere il Microsoft Store più attraente sia per gli utenti che per gli sviluppatori.Nel negozio online sono già stati inseriti browser come Firefox e Opera GX, CCleaner e Audacity.Presto Microsoft renderà molto più semplice reinstallare le applicazioni scaricate attraverso lo store, cosa che può essere davvero pratica quando si reinstalla Windows o si passa a un nuovo PC.Il Microsoft Store sarà anche in grado di riconoscere le applicazioni correntemente in esecuzione rimandando il loro aggiornamento a un secondo momento.]]></summary>
