Tutti i PC e i server che già montino una release precedente sono dunque aggiornabili, senza che sia necessario formattare, reinstallare da zero o perdere i propri dati. Questa guida mostra dunque come aggiornare a Ubuntu 22.04 LTS tramite linea di comando. La procedura funziona sia con Ubuntu Desktop (l'edizione dotata di interfaccia grafica e rivolta ai PC) sia su Ubuntu Server. È stata testata partendo sia da Ubuntu 21.10 (la versione immediatamente precedente), sia da Ubuntu 20.04 (la versione LTS del 2020), ma è compatibile con qualsiasi generazione. Procediamo!

Not only you’ll shorten the lifespan of your processor, you’ll also get less processing power because of thermal throttling.
    
One of the easiest ways to tackle heating issues is getting a good CPU cooler. This post looks at the different types of coolers out there and helps you select the right one for your CPU.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to open URLs from a container on the host system's browser. I am trying to do so using dbus and xdg-desktop-portal [1]. However, running
 gdbus call --session --dest="org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop" --object-path=/org/freedesktop/portal/desktop --method=org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop.OpenURI '' 'https://example.com' '{}'
 I get:
 Error: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.UnknownMethod: No such interface “org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop” on object at path /org/freedesktop/portal/desktop
 I get the same error irrespective of whether I run the command inside the container or the host. Both xdg-desktop-portal and xdg-desktop-portal-kde are running. To diagnose, I tried:
 gdbus introspect --session --dest="org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop" --object-path=/org/freedesktop/portal/desktop
 and get:
 node /org/freedesktop/portal/desktop { [ ... snip ... ] interface org.freedesktop.portal.OpenURI { methods: OpenURI(in s parent_window, in s uri, in a{sv} options, out o handle); OpenFile(in s parent_window, in h fd, in a{sv} options, out o handle); OpenDirectory(in s parent_window, in h fd, in a{sv} options, out o handle); signals: properties: readonly u version = 3; }; }; 
 Also, opening the file manager works fine:
 gdbus call --session --dest="org.freedesktop.FileManager1" --object-path=/org/freedesktop/FileManager1 --method=org.freedesktop.FileManager1.ShowItems "['file:///tmp']" ""
 I'm not sure why the error says interface “org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop” does not exist for org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop.OpenURI (removing '.Desktop' here didn't help either).
 Alternatively, if there's another method to open a URL from a container on the host, that works for me too. Any help in getting this to work would be appreciated.

 The Arch BBS give Alad some nice compliments on his coding, so I wanted to learn by getting more familiar with this specific project. Have already learned a lot just by reading through some of the code.
 I was able to make the wrapper (aur) and the bash & zsh completions just by running the make command in the directory.
 I can also make a the package aurutils-git-9.6.r6.gf2adfa3-1-any.pkg.tar.zst with these commands:
 cd makepkg makepkg -s 
 However, that does not use the makefile (and I think it also doesn't use my local copies of the source). I don't know much about makefiles yet. However, I want to learn the way of doing things that AladW intended to be used for this project.
 Do I need to add a makepkg target to the makefile? The level of attention to detail in this project is incredible, so I'm sure nothing like this was simply overlooked. I'm trying to understand the the recommended way to generate the package file (preferably automated)? I also want to sign it, but I can figure that out next.

 I'm following the instructions on the Wiki page and am running into diffuculties. 
 sudo pacman -S wine does not work for some reason, it can't find the package. I tried git cloning wine-stable but when I run makepkg -si, it says there are dependencies missing. I tried installing the dependancies by running sudo pacman -S lib32-alsa-lib but pacman can't find the packages. There is no git clone available for them either. Perhaps I'm looking for an easy way to install all dependencies at once, or maybe it's the installation method that needs fixing.
 I also tried makepkg --install --syncdeps --cleanbuild which did not work. 
 Any help is greatly appreciated.

 I'm trying:
 window-rule = [ {window_class = "transmission", spawn_on_tag = 2}, {window_class = "Steam", spawn_on_tag = 3}, ]
 It doesn't work. 
 I already tried using window_title instead of window_class, changing the capitalization (Transmission, steam) but nothing worked. Any way to make it work?

Ad esempio, tra le lacune di sicurezza scoperte nei vari software che meritano maggiore attenzione ci sono quelle legate al funzionamento dello spooler della stampante. È vero che in passato l'applicazione di queste patch ha causato qualche problema (ne parliamo nell'articolo su come eliminare la coda di stampa e sbloccare la stampante) ma l'installazione è divenuta una necessità sempre più pressante dal momento che i bug individuati in Windows sono sempre più sfruttati dai criminali informatici.Nella colonna Due date è riportata la data entro la quale CISA obbliga gli enti pubblici a installare le patch di sicurezza per ciascuno dei problemi in elenco.Il catalogo delle vulnerabilità vede la presenza di riferimenti a soluzioni software di utilizzo comune ma anche router, applicazioni industriali, applicazioni Web, strumenti per la virtualizzazione e apparati per il networking.Cliccando su Download CSV version è possibile aprire la lista compilata e aggiornata da CISA con un qualunque foglio di calcolo.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been searching for this but I cannot find an answer. I use Yakuake as my primary terminal emulator, and I'd like to clear my history. I've tried the following:
 $ history -c
 Errors out with bad option -c
 ​
 $ echo "" > .bash_history
 $ echo "" > .histfile (this is the file that is set in my .zshrc for history)
 $ echo "" > .zsh_history
 ​
 None of these have actually cleared the history from yakuake. If I run $ history it still has all of the entries. In Konsole, I've set the history to use .histfile instead of /tmp (due to the same trouble trying to clear the history), but that doesn't seem to affect yakuake. Also, when Konsole was set to use /tmp as history, it never actually erased it; I thought /tmp was supposed to be erased upon reboot?
 ​
 How do I clear the history?

Just as a note my system isn't old even close. I got a RTX 3060 and a 5th gen Ryzen CPU it's just NVIDIA or ASUS just sucks at giving BIOS updates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the past I have simply hosted my own Nextcloud within my home folder and put whatever I cared about in there. This was "good enough" for my needs. After drive failures, I'm able to just sync the nextcloud and have it back, but I still need to manually reconfigure everything how I like it. I've also gotten lucky that a secondary drive that I don't have backed up simply hasn't failed yet.
 What I would like to do is have a way to back everything up that doesn't involve me literally saving every file, but rather... - periodically save the list of explicitly installed packages from standard repos - periodically save explicitly installed packages from elsewhere - periodically save the non-default configuration files - periodically save the systemd services running (have not researched how to do this yet) - periodically save select directories not already included in my cloud, including home directory which is the source of most user configurations
 I don't care about backing up the OS itself, since I can simply reinstall it. I don't want to backup programs, games, etc. that could all be easily replaced by reinstalling.
 Where this gets complicated is if I save something like a configuration file in /etc/some/directory/foo.conf then if I am not saving the entire /etc structure then I'd end up with a bunch of random foo.conf files in a directory that I would need to manually install. Is this really as simple as back /etc/?

Si tratta delle versioni 'stand alone' di Office che sono legate, in termini di licenza, al singolo dispositivo e non prevedono il versamento di alcun canone di abbonamento mensile o annuale come avviene invece nel caso di Microsoft 365.Ancora oggi Office 2013 riceve aggiornamenti regolari e ogni mese l'azienda di Redmond distribuisce patch di sicurezza per risolvere le problematiche via via emerse.A meno di 'cambi di programma', che sono comunque da ritenersi piuttosto improbabili, dopo l'11 aprile 2023 gli utenti di Office 2013 non riceveranno più alcun aggiornamento attraverso Windows Update.]]></summary>

On this display manager, there is a gui option to "hibernate". Today I accidentally clicked this option, and when I tried to boot my computer back up, I was take directly to my Windows partition without first going to GRUB. I checked my bios(HP laptop) and the grub entry was missing altogether. I went to the bios' boot menu, manually selected the grubx64.efi file from my boot partition, and successfully booted Arch again. Now that my bios doesn't have a grub uefi entry, I need to add it back. I've tried a few things:
 ​
 First, I ran grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg, which resulted in:

 done. However, when I called efibootmgr, it still didn't show the uefi entry.
 Next, I decided to manually create an entry using efibootmgr, so I ran efibootmgr -c -d /dev/nvme0n1p1 -p 7 -L GRUB -l \EFI\GRUB\grubx64.efi, after which efibootmgr showed that there was a new 'GRUB' entry. 
 However, when I load back into the bios, there still isn't a GRUB entry, and the only thing there is Windows. Secure boot is disabled. Is there something else I can try?

In short, this is Power management bug with first generation Rayzen Zenmicroarchitecture for the CPU to go to sleep mode yeas you heard it right, the CPU somehow's think the laptop is now on sleep mode like the laptop screen were turned down OFF. 
 Looks like with recent Kernel updates this issue were fixed, BTW I want to mention other thing that Archlinux were the only Linux distro that were able to detect my Laptop eMMC internal drive, since HP made it only visible on UEFI shell mode made Windows 10 &11 the only OS function to this laptop, until Arch Linux did the miracle, supporting that new mode, allowing me to enjoy the Linux experience, even when HP support reply to this Laptop supports Windows 10/11 only.

It's currently autologging and starting Steam, with the others set up as shortcuts through Steam, but I would love to give the non-steam software a first-class billing rather than being "things accessible through steam".
 Given that they all offer .session files, it seems like the place for a display manager to shine. Unfortunately everything I've used so far puts user selection front and centre (I only ever want one user for normal gameplay purposes), and tend to hide session selection in a small, mouse-only menu.
 Are there any display managers or greeters out there that prioritise Session selection? Bonus points for large graphical displays and gamepad-focussed navigation.

But, today, I experienced a freeze where neither Ctrl+Alt+Fx nor Alt+SysRq+REISUB worked. The underside led of the mouse, was off too. It is usually lit before I even start X, so I don't think it has anything to do with X. I don't know how to troubleshoot this. Well, it was only one freeze. But I am, and will be for a few weeks, in the middle of critical, stressful work where I can't afford to be randomly interrupted, or to lose data.
 Sooo, my question is, did you guys experience similar freezes recently? Or is it just me? If so, how would you recommend I should troubleshoot?
 As a matter of fact, the only two times I experienced repeated freezes on a similar system were hardware related (once ram, once psu). So I'm not optimistic..

Come abbiamo visto negli anni precedenti, tuttavia, il fatto che Android sarà ovviamente al centro del palcoscenico non esclude che Google non abbia qualche sorpresa in serbo.Durante la Google I/O 2021 la società di Mountain View ha presentato l'importante aggiornamento di Wear OS confermando l'interesse per il settore dei dispositivi indossabili. A contribuire al rinnovamento ci ha pensato Samsung che con Google ha impostato una collaborazione incentrata proprio sugli indossabili e su Wear OS.La novità di quest'anno potrebbe essere Android TV 13, sistema operativo destinato alle smart TV di nuova generazione e ai dispositivi multimediali 'da salotto' come TV box e similari.Dopo la resurrezione di Wear OS e i primi passi di Android L, versione specifica di Android per i dispositivi dotati di display più ampio, Google sta ora preparando qualcosa di nuovo per le TV, un altro settore in cui ha mostrato un interesse limitato negli ultimi tempi.Android TV 13 introdurrà miglioramenti relativi all'efficienza energetica e una serie di novità volte a limitare il numero delle notifiche presentate così da impedire il 'risveglio' del dispositivo quando in 'modalità sleep'.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Word processors are great. They can handle basic composition jobs such as writing letters and essays. However, word processors cannot easily handle documents with custom layouts and graphs.
    
This is because word processors such as Microsoft’s Word and Libreoffice’s Writer are not designed for those tasks. As such, this can be incredibly limiting if you want to create documents with unusual formats and symbols.
    
Knowing that, one way to get around this problem is by using a flexible document language such as TeX. From there, you can then use a preparation program such as LaTeX to output your TeX file into a printable document.
