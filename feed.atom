 ​
 After I came back to Arch I noticed that I wasn't getting that much updates like I used to before switching to FreeBSD I remember there was no day where one single update was released and the lack of updates is kind of nice but scary, is it normal? is it happening to anyone else?

 This error is from Xorg.0.log file. I have been experiencing a lot of tearing issues on my arch install and I believe it is due to incorrect drivers. I tried reading the wiki but couldn't solve this problem.
 ​
 mpv --hwdec=auto foo.mkv output:

VO: [gpu] 1366x768 vaapi[nv12] 
 but when I play the same video with LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=i965 contraint the errors disappear:

 Maybe this will help in tracing the problem. I don't know if this is another issue entirely.

After install the original sata SSD to p52, I've reinstalled the GRUB and grub-install for the bios, as well as mkinitcpio -p linux. The GRUB is installed, and I am able to get into the login page. I am not using any display manager so it is just plain login page default in arch. After I login, the whole screen start freezing. ( Not even entered X). 
 May I ask how can I enter X?
 Edit: I do have another two SSD install, one of them is having windows installed. Is this matter?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Screensavers aren’t technically necessary in today’s age of low-energy LCD, OLED and IPS panels. Traditionally, screensavers were used to prevent burn-in on heat-emitting CRT monitors, which isn’t something modern monitors need to worry about. The reality is that if you actually want to preserve your screen, you just switch it off!
    
Still, screensavers can look super-pretty, and whether you want one for nostalgic reasons or to show off the eye-popping colors of your IPS monitor, it’s up to you. You can still use screensavers in Windows 10 and Windows 11, so we’ve gathered the best ones for you here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I am pretty sure it's easy topic but cannot find any info about proper way of doing it.
 I configure my dzen2 panel under bspwm and sometimes I need to provide additional information on some command.
 In my specific case I have a list of AP SSID got by
 nmcli d wifi | awk -v col=3 '{if (NR>1) {print $col}}'
 and would like to connect to specific network with click.
 So if network is already in nmcli c I can just run nmcli c up SSID, but the problems begins when I need to provide password to run
 nmcli d wifi connect SSID password PASS
 So, how can I do that? Is my overall approach good? And is there some common practice to provide an intermiediate popup for providing input and then run command? I know I could probably use some NetworkManager tool that have it integrated, but I see more usecases (e.g. I have list of commands to run and some of them can get extra parameters)
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys!
 I've been setting up my Linux machine for work. But lately I had some core dumps errors.
 Some of the programs I encountered are these:
 - Autodesk Maya (Fixed restoring with timeshift)
 -SideFX houdini (munmap_chunk(): invalid pointer [1] 97909 IOT instruction (core dumped) )
 -Qt5ct (lightly-qt error)
 ​
 I feel like there's more programs that could be affected, I'll edit the post if I encounter them.
 I don't know what's causing this, I never had this problem before. Anyone knows any way to source the error and fix it?
 Thanks in advance.

 Today I ran pacman -Syu and got flatpak installed on my box.
 I don't use flatpak, I don't want flatpak on my system, yet now I can't get rid of it.
 Turns out malcontent, a dependency of gnome-control-center, depends on it.
 So Gnome effectively can't be used without installed flatpak now.

 Edit: For some reason the bottles schema was compiled to /usr/local/share/glib-2.0/schema, unlike every other schema on the system. This one was overwriting the correct schema the aur package put in /usr/share. Deleting it fixed this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! I like Arch Linux in its simplicity and flexibility for maybe 10 years now.
 The one thing I would like to have improved is handling and tracking manual system configurations.
 For example giving this situation:
 After installing Arch, you "fiddle" with some config files according to the Arch Wiki. It works perfectly and you probably forget about these files.
 But years later these old configurations may break newest package versions and problems may begin.
 Also sometimes I find config files which probably were part of a package but now are orphaned. May be I'm wrong but that should not happen.
 The concept of pacnew files is not that optimal in my opinion.
 Because Arch Linux is quite flexible, there should be a nice solution to modify my favourite distribution without changing it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I posted this in the new people thread, and was told to make it a proper post, so I've copy-pasted my post there to here.
 So I recently installed arch, and am using sway. I also use a usb switch to share my keyboard/mouse with my laptop (which has arch) and my desktop. Additionally, I run my laptop in clamshell mode (laptop lid is closed while output goes to an external monitor).
 I've noticed that if I let the laptop idle long enough to turn off the external monitor, then switch my usb switch to my desktop, then switch back, the computer will suspend a few seconds after un-idling. I looked in the journal, and basically as soon as the usb switch reconnected systemd-logind suspends the computer. I was just wondering what exactly the issue is here, because it's rather annoying having to open the laptop lid to wake up the computer after being on my desktop for a little while.
 If more information is needed, I can provide it. I'm kinda new to arch, so I've provided what I thought was relevant.
 Recently, oddly enough, this pattern has seemed to stop, and I'm not sure why. If anyone has any insight, I would appreciate it, if not just to simply learn more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I don't really know where to post this, so it's here and on r/Terraria. 
 I have a Lenovo ThinkPad L390 (i5-8265U, UHD620) running on Arch with bspwm. 
 The benchmarks I found online all show that I should be able to run it at stable 60 fps on 1920x1080, even with high settings. Steam built-in fps counter shows 60, but the game stutters so much it looks like 20 or less frames. It's like freezing for .x of a second every frame. I tried running it natively and through Proton, works the same. I can't really test it on Windows, because I'm not dual-booting. 
 I'm updating everything through pacman almost daily (-Syu), so there's no way I have obsolete drivers. 
 I really don't know what more I can do. 
 I have 1x8GB RAM, swap file of 8GB, running it with gamemode and turbo boost (Intel CPU) on without any unnecessary programs in the background (Discord, Spotify, etc.). Of course the CPU governor is set to performance and I'm playing with AC plugged in. I allocated the most RAM to the iGPU the BIOS let me (512MB). 
 I even found some launch options for Terraria on Steam and nothing seemed to work.
 Of course I tried lowering the settings in game, even to the lowest, and nothing changed. I lowered the resolution too, but it looks shitty even on 1600x900 and I wasn't able to move the cursor to the edge of my screen (the cursor space was 1600x900 even though the game was still rendering in fullscreen?).
 Help please, I don't want to play the mobile port:(

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I followed the arch wiki guide on setting up hibernation. Added boot parameters in grub (by editing etc/defaults/grub), did grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg, edited hooks in /etc/mkinitcpio.conf and did sudo mkinitcpio -p linux. When i try to hibernate my ThinkPad, it shuts down, instantly wakes up and does a clean boot "from scratch". It saves the state to disk but doesn't resume from it. When I did cat /proc/cmdline i can see that i lack the resume parameter. how to add it?
 EDIT: i fixed it by adding it using grub-customizer.

 I can set the GTK_THEME environnment variable to Adwaita:dark, but this only affects applications direcly. Some applications, though, weirdly look differently when launched using gapplication (gnome-weather, gapplication launch org.gnome.Weather)
 In case it might be useful, these are the contents of my ~/.config/gtk-4.0/settings.ini:

 Is there any way to get gapplication to use a GTK theme? Thanks a lot in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I did a full system backup. At first I had major problems with the new kernel which are now solved.
 Now a new problem appeared. My i3wm seems to be freezing at random so that I am locked inside the last focused window. I can't change focus or anything - not even reloading or using the mouse.
 ​
 The most likely cause as far as I read has been the kernel. So I switched to linux-lts. I also switched to linux-lts-header and nvidia-lts. I have run mkinitcpio for nvidia and grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg. Furthermore, I added another hook for nvidia-lts to pacman and reinstalled optimus-manager (to be on the safe side). To check whether my system complains I removed nvidia, optimus-manager is set to always start with nvidia atm. So far the transition seem to have run smoothly. Problem is the freezing remains. Everything else is absolutely fine so far.
 ​
 What else can cause this malicious behaviour. Which console outputs or logs are there keep hold of the error(s)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft lo stava sviluppando ormai da più di un anno: conosciuto con il nome in codice di Project Monarch, si tratta di un client di posta elettronica per Windows che raccoglierà l'eredità di Outlook, disponibile in molteplici versioni.L'obiettivo del nuovo One Outlook è quello di presentare agli utenti un'applicazione che funziona nello stesso identico modo su qualunque dispositivo venga usata. Quasi sicuramente dovrebbe soppiantare le tradizionali applicazioni Posta e Calendario integrate in Windows.Durante le fasi di sviluppo di Project Monarch Microsoft ha preferito non mostrare alcuna anteprima e continuare a sviluppare internamente il nuovo Outlook.Il design complessivo riflette quello della versione Web di Outlook, al momento non sembra supportare account utente Microsoft di tipo personale (ma la cosa cambierà di sicuro da qui al momento del rilascio ufficiale) e non sembrano essere previsti particolari add-on.La novità più evidente a colpo d'occhio è che le principali funzioni dell'applicazione sono state posizionate nella parte superiore della finestra, a destra.

Le email si aprono invece in una finestra dedicata, similmente a quanto avviene oggi.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hate when commands fail. Normally I update my system with pacman -Syu but sometimes the archlinux-keyring package needs to updated in which case after it fails, I run pacman -S archlinux-keyring && pacman -Su (I don't need to refresh the database because I just did it and in the end my system is fully upgraded so it is not a partial upgrade).
 I could always just run pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring && pacman -Su but that seems like a waste if the keyring does not need to be updated. So in the Arch spirit of over engineering a solution, I was thinking I could write a script that calls pacman -Syup and does some regex foo to get a the list of packages that need to be updated. If the keyring is in that list, the script could then makes sure it is updated first.
 How do you keep the keyring package updated so pacman does not fail?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You might have accidentally (or not) deleted files from your Windows PC at one point or another and wondered whether you can restore them from the Recycle Bin. The good news is that you can do so without much fuss.
    
Windows automatically places files from folders or external devices in the Recycle Bin when you delete them, so you can easily recover these with just a few clicks. If you’ve permanently deleted a file, however, you won’t be able to restore it through the Recycle Bin. Luckily, there are other advanced methods for recovering your files, as we shall see below. 
    
Note: the methods included in this article are compatible with Windows 10/11.
   

Content

1. From Recycle Bin
2. Bring Back Previous File Versions
3. With Command Prompt
4. Using Windows File Recovery Tool

 Summary:
  
Full System Upgrade but for unknown reasons boot wasn't updated/mounted (guess)
 Reboot - boot couldn't be mounted kernel modules couldn't be loaded
 Downgraded from linux-5.17.5.arch1-1 to linux-5.17.1.arch1-1
 Rebooted - was able to boot again normally - run pacman -Su - started from above
 Settled with the downgraded version in hope it works and also downgraded linux-headers to the same version due to complaints after reboots I reached the point where I figured some problems and created this thread

 Also, booting from my installation media takes much longer as well. Attempted a BIOS reset, but my laptop doesn't have a CMOS battery; took out the main battery, which I don't think did anything.
