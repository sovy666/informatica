        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[WhatsApp stickers are a great way of zazzing up your chats, adding plenty of color, quips and cartoon faces to your conversations. WhatsApp doesn’t have an incedible selection of emojis by default, but go a couple of taps further, and you can find a whole world of sticker packs that you can download to add hundreds of emojis and images to your WhatsApp sticker collection.
    
You can also go further afield in search of sticker packs, but there are many bad ones out there, with some even trying to rope you into subscriptions (don’t do it!), so here we’ve rounded up the best WhatsApp sticker packs for you to safely use.

Specifically what i'm trying to do is make the output of "pacman -Ss" have a different color or bold the version numbers or something like that so the package name itself could be highlighted and just make the text more human readable. 
 Currently I'm using zsh with pl10k but I'm not super aware of how to find different modifiers for that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there. I recently decided to switch to latest kernel instead of lts kernel. I installed linux and linux-headers. Then I uninstalled linux-lts and linux-lts-headers. But I forgot to update grub config and rebooted my computer. Grub said me there is no linux-lts as expected.
 I edited the boot entry by pressing "C" key because my grub theme says press "C" to edit entry.
 The entry was like 
 load\_video set gfxpayload=keep insmod gzio insmod part\_gpt insmod fat search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root EAB5-2070 echo 'Loading Linux linux-lts ...' linux /vmlinuz-linux-lts root=UUID=aa92f198-68cf-45a1-a788-0fe6caca5289 rw rootflags=subvol=@ rootfstype=btrfs loglevel=3 quiet echo 'Loading initial ramdisk ...' initrd /amd-ucode.img /initramfs-linux-lts-fallback.img 
 I just deleted "-lts" parts from the code and I'd able to boot my linux. Then I update grub config by typing:
 # grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
 I want to shared my experience because If someone do the same, This post may be helpful. So I publish that as "Support | Solved".

Don’t even think this smart TV has this type of discount because it’s old, as it was just released in December. You’ll get a wide color gamut for a more colorful and vibrant picture. Dolby Vision HDR and HDR10+ add to the viewing experience even more, as does the Regza Engine 4K.
    
The backlight panel has a full array of local dimming, which separates the LEDs into more controlled, smaller areas for the TV to have more control over where it adds more light. Add to that the 480 Motion Rate panel that provides smooth, fluid movement, even in gaming and the fastest action movies.

 Been trying to install and configure Nvidia drivers following this guide: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA_Optimus#Use_NVIDIA_graphics_only
 I've already installed nvidia-lts and xorg-xrandr.
 I've also created 10-nvidia-drm-outputclass.conf as shown on the Wiki, the only difference being that I changed Driver to "nvidia-lts", since I'm using linux-lts.
 ~ xrandr --listmonitors Monitors: 1 0: +eDP-1 1600/344x900/193+0+0 eDP-1 
 the command above just outputs my integrated display, but I do have an HDMI connected to my laptop.
 I'm using lightdm with this display setup script:
 ​
 #!/bin/sh intern=eDP-1 extern=HDMI-0 if xrandr | grep "$extern disconnected"; then xrandr --output "$extern" --off --output "$intern" --primary --mode 1600x900 --pos 0x180 --rotate normal --brightness 0.65 else xrandr --output "$intern" --mode 1600x900 --pos 0x1800 --rotate normal --brightness 0.65 --output "$extern" --primary --right-of "$intern" --mode 2560x1080 --pos 1600x0 --rotate normal fi 
 ​
 My goal is to make xrandr detect my HDMI connection so I can use my external monitor but it looks like my Nvidia driver isn't initializing properly:
 sudo nvidia-xconfig WARNING: Unable to locate/open X configuration file. ERROR: Unable to find any GPUs in the system. New X configuration file written to '/etc/X11/xorg.conf' 
 Although it says it was unable to find any GPU, lspci lists it:
 ~ lspci | grep VGA 00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation CoffeeLake-H GT2 [UHD Graphics 630] 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GP107M [GeForce GTX 1050 Mobile] (rev a1)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nel caso dei supporti di memorizzazione, la formattazione è quella particolare procedura che permette di predisporre il supporto che accoglierà i dati: si pensi a un hard disk, un'unità SSD, una chiavetta USB, una scheda SD o un qualunque altro supporto di memorizzazione esterno.Formattare significa quindi preparare un supporto di memorizzazione per renderlo idoneo all'archiviazione di dati. A stretto rigore, un'unità viene dapprima inizializzata ovvero predisposta a livello logico con la creazione di una o più partizioni secondo un preciso schema di partizionamento (GPT o MBR).Le partizioni di hard disk, SSD e unità rimovibili vengono utilizzate per suddividere i dati. In una partizione, ad esempio, si può installare il sistema operativo mentre l'altra accoglierà i dati.Nel caso di molti sistemi operativi vengono create, sullo stesso supporto, una partizione che si occupa di gestire la procedura di avvio mentre in un'altra vengono salvati i file che fanno funzionare il sistema vero e proprio (e che vengono caricati successivamente).]]></summary>

 I looked at my router (which is a Fritz!Box 7530) but it is reporting no issues. I've also tried with / without my VPN.
 Next I tried to traceroute various servers: google.com, ddg.co, speedtest.net, and converge.io (my company's website), with the following results:

Certamente no. Ed ecco quindi che la società guidata da Jeff Bezos ha presentato il suo CodeWhisperer, uno strumento che come Copilot si basa sull'intelligenza artificiale e che consente agli sviluppatori di ottenere codice funzionante già pronto semplicemente scrivendo il nome di una funzione o descrivendo ciò che si desidera con il linguaggio naturale.

Anche CodeWhisperer è stato addestrato con milioni di righe di codice pubblicamente accessibili e per adesso supporta Java, JavaScript e Python.Per ora disponibile in anteprima come parte di AWS IDE Toolkit può essere utilizzato da ogni sviluppatore all'interno di qualunque IDE, inclusi Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm e Amazon AWS Cloud 9.]]></summary>

It doesn't support blur or shadows or rounded corners, but I am waiting for hyprland to implement it with no issues and it being easy to use. So for new I am using sway-borders-git and hyprland-git. However, really wanna tinker around with stacking window managers because I sometimes miss them. Not from a efficiency standpoint but from a ricing one. When I looked it up tho, I couldn't really find any stacking Wayland compositors using wlroots-git. Does anyone know any? Preferably supporting shadows, blur and rounded corners.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, so here's what I was trying to achieve: map Caps key to Escape and map Shift+Caps to CapsLock.
 I quickly found multiple posts about it: https://superuser.com/questions/1458800/xmodmap-remap-caps-lock-to-escape-and-shiftcaps-lock-to-caps-lock and https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=248433 are some examples.
 TL;DR there are 2 solutions to it:
 - Using setxkbmap: setxkbmap -option 'caps:escape_shifted_capslock'
 - Using xmodmap: xmodmap -e 'clear lock' and then xmodmap -e 'keycode 66 = Escape Caps_Lock NoSymbol NoSymbol'
 Both solutions have the the same issue: when Shift+Caps is pressed both Escape and CapsLock are triggered.
 Anyone knows a way around this?

L'Autorità ha ammonito l'azienda ingiungendo alla stessa di conformarsi al Regolamento europeo (GDPR) entro il termine perentorio di 90 giorni.Esaminando quanto pubblicato dal Garante ci si rende conto di come la decisione sia stata assunta in seguito a una lunga e complessa istruttoria che si è sviluppata anche in coordinamento con il lavoro svolto dalle altre Autorità privacy europee.L'aspetto più rilevante che emerge in conclusione è l'illiceità dei trasferimenti effettuati verso gli Stati Uniti e in particolare attraverso Google Analytics, il servizio di web analytics gratuito fornito dall'azienda di Mountain View che permette di generare statistiche dettagliate sui visitatori di un sito Web. Il codice Google Analytics viene caricato via JavaScript dal browser ed è presente in tutte le pagine Web dei siti (oggi la stragrande maggioranza) che utilizzano la piattaforma per compilare statistiche in tempo reale.Il Garante italiano, confermando le decisioni che erano arrivate da altre Autorità europee nei mesi scorsi, ha stabilito che l'utilizzo di Google Analytics vìola le disposizioni a tutela della privacy degli utenti.]]></summary>

The company settled an Australian lawsuit over its claims the devices were water resistant and agreed to pay $14 million as a result.

Samsung’s Water Resistant Claims
    
The Australia Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) initially launched a lawsuit against Samsung in 2019 over the water-resistant claims of Galaxy phones. The seven models in question are the S7, S7 Edge, A5, A7, S8, S8 Plus, and Note 8.

 So I did a fresh install of EndeavourOS and when I installed discord, it did not work as expected. I could log in, but afterwards it didn't respond and was very glitchy and unresponsive.
 I tried installing from flatpak, all of the other versions... none worked.
 I even tried with GNOME instead of i3wm, it crashed on startup.
 However, in my other laptop discord is perfectly fine and stable, while using Arch too.
 ​
 Any ideas?

 xfce4-screensaver is the offending program. I pacman -Rns 'd it and when I close my laptop lip, I get a black screen I can't escape from. I have to press CTRL + ALT + F2 in order to get to a text-based login screen, where I can poweroff the computer.
 Clicking the Lock Screen Button, Logging Out, and Restarting still all work properly displaying "dm-tool lock".
 How can I set "dm-tool lock" in place of wherever xfce4-screensaver was active?
  
 I am running a nearly fresh install of Arch Linux with XFCE4.
 I would like to mandate that the only screen locker ever used is "dm-tool lock" which I think is called "LightDM GTK Greeter".
 I've run a few commands now that I honestly don't remember (important thing is they don't work).
 I am able to mandate "dm-tool lock" for all cases so far except when I close the lid on my laptop randomly.
 I am met on opening it with a strange different screen locker that looks similar but has none of my settings, no clock panel, etc.
 How do I...
  
Purge the false screen locker from my system for eternity
 Mandate "dm-tool lock" as the one locker to rule them all
  
 BONUS ROUND
 Is there any reason "dm-tool lock" is not worthy of being my screen locker? Is it secure in all cases?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 So recently I've decided to create an interesting project: Use FreeBSD as a guest with my dGPU via GPU Passthrough. But it's got a lot of caveats to it and I wonder if someone could help me.
 The first reason why I'm not installing straight into my machine is because it's a Surface Book (1st Gen - Performance Base Edition) which doesn't even recognize the keyboard after trying to install it via an external one. So it has to have a Linux kernel and run it as a guest.
 The second problem is that despite running almost perfectly, the laptop requires a custom kernel called surface-linux in order to have stable WiFi connection and recognize the NVIDIA dGPU.
 Following along, the third problem was switching between the iGPU and the dGPU. In that case, I've opted for the optimus-manager project in order to switch between them. It's works great with Arch.
 So the only way I could run FreeBSD with the NVIDIA dGPU would be by using a Type 1 Hypervisor such as KVM. That would be the only way to get the GPU Passthrough.
 I've read ArchWiki article regarding GPU Passthrough extensively. I was able to isolate the NVIDIA dGPU, by loading only the vfio-pci drivers when turning on, but I'm still not able to connect with the VM using it.
 One thing to notice is that when using lspci the NVIDIA dGPU appear as 3D Graphics, and not VGA. I'm pretty sure this is the reason why I cannot fully detach it.
 Can anyone help me with this project?

 My monitor connected via a USB-C dock connected to my laptop will show the login screen, but as soon as the KDE Wayland session is started the monitor will show "No signal". The monitor will still be "detected", my laptop's display (which is working correctly) will not be the primary display, as if the external monitor is still functioning. If I connect the monitor after starting the KDE session, everything works normally. I haven't tried recreating this issue on X because even if that fixed the issue, I need to scale my laptop monitor separately from my external monitor.
 I'm not sure how to debug this issue myself so if anyone could tell me where to start looking or a possible fix for this issue, please let me know.

I don't like having the kernel exposed in fat partition, so I decided to make a esp at /boot/efi and a reliable xfs extended boot partition (/boot) in theory since systemd 250 you can load EFI drivers which are on EFI/systems/drivers on the esp so I put the efifs driver in there and followed the systemd-boot installation, but when I reboot I get an error that the xfs_64.efi image couldn't be loaded (load error) and subsequently the kernel and initrd fails to start.
 I have tried to load the driver from the EFI shell and loads just fine and I can read from the partition.

The unlocked SAMSUNG Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G Smartphone solves that by offering two side-by-side screens that combine to become a larger screen. If you’re unsure, read on, as it’s currently $500 off.
    
Folded, it’s a smartphone that fits in your pocket, yet unfolded, it becomes a slim tablet. The 7.6″ 120Hz AMOLED 2X screen is clear, with everything appearing larger than on a standard smartphone. 25W Super Fast Charging (sold separately or as an add-on) and the 4,400mAh battery increase your options even more.
   
 
   
Galaxy Flex Mode allows you to fold it at any angle and hold it however is comfortable to you. Three multi-windows allow you to check your calendar while editing and create presentations from multiple sources. If you add on an S Pen (sold separately), it... Read more]]></summary>

The experience has been good so far except some minor lags and FPS drops, that are a result of using an Nvidia GPU with KDE desktop. I've found that the best solution to this problem is to simply switch to the integrated Intel GPU since I don't really use the PC for anything other than casual Internet usage and homework. My question here Is: is removing the nvidia package enough ? I would like to know your opinion, specially if you've got a better solution to the lag problem...

With AirDroid Cast, it’s as easy as installing the software and entering a code. It’s designed to simplify screen casting and mirroring so that you can focus on sharing what’s on your phone or computer screen with others. I recently had the pleasure of seeing how well AirDroid worked in action.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Friends.
 I launched the curated user repository a few weeks ago and now comes the package manager to go with it.
 AUR packages are reviewed and whitelisted. Additional package recipes are directly shipped with the curated repo.
 So far it works really well. But it is brand-new - so please bear with me, if something goes wrong. Please file a github issue, if you encounter a bug.
 Right now, the basic feature set is implemented. You can use it to install and remove packages. Additional features are planned in the future. Please give it a try and let me know in the comments, if there is something you wish to have.
 Also... Feel free to file a github pull request, if there is a package you'd like to have included.
 I created a helper script, that makes it very easy to add additional packages to the AUR whitelist. If you want to bump a package version, simply re-run the script with the package name and it will update to the latest version:
  $ aur-whitelist build2 # whitelist build2 4424cce8e2f4d87fa54b1b53a354dec7d784e8f9 build2 $ aur-whitelist build2 # already up-to-date already accepted, skipping: build2 
 -- flydude
 P.S.: Some of you might wonder, if this qualifies as an AUR helper. Not really, I'd say. We do include high-quality packages from the AUR. But the packages are reviewed and maintained inside a single git repo. Therefore it's more like Gentoo Portage (hence the name).
