 After about 10 minutes or so, I can no longer search with Firefox, I can't open any program other than terminal and Thunar. I can get some commands to work with terminal but once I use sudo it seems to not output anything.
 I'm at a loss as to what im supposed to do, any help would be greatly appreciated.

 I've installed openbox and xfce4-panel as one user, and as another user Plasma is installed. From what I've gathered, the commands 'systemctl suspend' or 'pm-suspend' should suspend the system and wake it up with a mouse movement or a key press, and it doesn't wake up, but it does in Plasma. What kind of magic incantation does Plasma use to achieve this?

At the bottom I was prompted to enter root password to enter maintenance mode. I thought it might've had something to do with the NFS mount I added to fstab but it seems not the case after I commented it out and rebooted to the same result.
 When I tried to do another Timeshift restore from the command line I was met with another error stating something like: '/dev/mapper/ not found'. Mega Arch noob here (probably in over my head tbh), any help would be appreciated. Thanks.
 Here's a link to a similar post I made in r/linux4noobs so that you can see the boot screen.

This is causing confusion to users who are wondering whether Hotmail is still around and if it will remain operational in the future. The following guide covers how you can retrieve an inactive Hotmail account, create a new Hotmail username, delete it, and change a Hotmail email address to an Outlook one.

code --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland
  
but I'd like to not have to type the flags every time. I tried putting the flags into ~/.config/electron-flags.conf and into .local/share/applications/code-oss.desktop
 But it has no effect.
 electron-flags.conf:
  --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland 
 desktop file:

 I'm thinking an alias could solve it, but I'd prefer to use the "proper" solution.

I am using the AUR and snaps using the command line. (I also noticed appimages aren't working)
 Is this a bug or is this something that usually happens on Vanilla Arch?
 (I am new to Arch, so please forgive me if I am missing something).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background
 I have an SSH server set up at home, and I expose it publicly on a non-standard port.
 Only two users are allowed access - "main" and "share". The "main" user is restricted to being accessed from 192.168.x.x addresses and is accessed solely by a key, and the "share" user can be accessed publicly with a strong password but is limited to folder access intended for sharing files with my family (achieved using "ChrootDirectory", "X11Forwarding", "AllowTcpForwarding", "PermitTTY", "PermitTunnel" and "ForceCommand").
 Additionally, I have fail2ban which blocks an IP after 5 failed attempts.
 The SSH server side of things is working as intended.
 Problem
 I guess the non-standard port isn't enough of a way to hide the server, as my fail2ban jail is filling up quite a bit, from what I can see using "journalctl -u sshd" there are daily access attempts from random IPs (which are successfully blocked).
 The problem however is that running "journalctl -u sshd" will typically only show about the last day's worth of logs, and show the warning "Journal file /var/log/journal/[long ID]/user-[ID]@[another long ID].journal is truncated, ignoring file." Ideally I'd like to view the whole thing.
 I've looked at https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd/Journal and also tried Googling around, but I can find an obvious cause/solution. A lot of places mention "/var/log/auth.log" but this doesn't seem to exist on my Arch instance.
 Do you know what may be causing this?
 Thanks for any advice at all!

 What kind of methods can I apply here, the kernel recognizes new devices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm a beginner with Arch, but I have used other distros for years, but never encountered this problem.
 I know Arch is famous because it's fully customizable to your needs, and that is also one of the reasons I switched to it, but I have this problem. 
 Some videos on certain websites don't load, I can understand that this is a codec issue, so I googled how to install codecs on Arch and used this command to install the codecs
 sudo pacman -S exfat-utils fuse-exfat a52dec faac faad2 flac jasper lame libdca libdv gst-libav libmad libmpeg2 libtheora libvorbis libxv wavpack x264 xvidcore gstreamer0.10-plugins flashplugin libdvdcss libdvdread libdvdnav gecko-mediaplayer dvd+rw-tools dvdauthor dvgrab
 However, after this some videos still don't play.
 I also tried with online tests to see what codec I was missing using this, and I can play all the videos except MPEG-4 Visual (In LibreWolf) . I only see "no video with supported format and MIME type found." In Tor Browser, I can't even play H.264 Baseline.
 Is this a browser issue? And how do I fix this?

 ​
 This caused a non-bootable os, so live usb was required to fix it back to old. How I could change the icon to the right one?

 My other question is, that how I can remove the grub2? It prints me: ':: removing grub breaks dependency 'grub' required by libguestfs' 
 And my guts tells me it will break everything if I delete libguestfs.

Eventually I gave up and reinstalled arch, everything was fine again and the same thing happened after running -Syu. I looked at the pacman.log file and downgraded the kernel, it still won't boot. I have systemd-boot and arch.conf looks the same as when it was working fine. I've tried mkinitcpio -P and -p linux as well as pacman -S linux all in chroot nothing has changed. The only thing i can find that is strange is that uname -srm and neofetch show a different kernel version(5.18.1) than the one I have installed which is 5.18.3. I don't know if this means anything but I can't see anything else wrong. Also pacman -Syu installed 5.18.5 which i downgraded back to 5.18.3. I have an amd gpu and cpu as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A week ago I installed Arch, and everything was working properly, but I woke up an hour ago to notice that the vast majority of my applications in .config/autostart failed to start when they did so just fine yesterday. This is my list of autostart apps: Discord, EasyEffects service, GWE, OpenRGB, Yakuake, qBittorrent and ProtonVPN. Out of all of those, the following worked initially or after I removed the entries and added them back in: EasyE, OpenRGB and Yakuake. The applications that failed to start work properly if I just run them from the application menu.
 I took a look at the journald log, and for all of the apps that failed to start, they showed something similar to this:
 /run/user/1000/systemd/generator.late/app-discord\x2dstable@autostart.service:18: WorkingDirectory= path is not absolute, ignoring: Starting Discord... app-discord\x2dstable@autostart.service: Main process exited, code=exited, status=1/FAILURE app-discord\x2dstable@autostart.service: Failed with result 'exit-code'. Failed to start Discord. 
 The ones that did start showed no such messages.
 I tried to modify those files under /run/user etc. but realized that they get altered on boot. I then tried to add a WorkingDirectory= line to the .config/autostart files in question with most of them pointing to /usr/bin but that didn't change anything either.
 I'm out of ideas and I need breakfast. Please help me out here.

 sddm[519]: Failed to read display number from pipe sddm[519]: Could not start Display server on vt 1 
 Read here sddm issue possibly due to .conf in xorg, so I removed the 30-touchpad.conf file. System booted no problem, but still, the inverted scrolling persisted. I reverted the main.conf bluetooth config and scrolling is normal, but have to connect bluetooth manually. Open to any suggestions or if someone can point me in the right direction to accomplish what I need or an explanation on why the bluetooth config would mess with my touchpad.

 About 3 days ago, Discord lost the ability to play any embedded video/sound, and notification sounds (but voice chat and voice chat stream audio is fine). And for some godforsaken reason, my friends also started to have this issue (they are also Ryzen and Arch Linux users and use pipewire).
 I have tried the pipewire-pulse config fix (Link), and tried both native and flatpak versions of Discord, but the issue still remains.
 Here are some information/logs:
 I'm running pipewire-1:0.3.52-2, pipewire-pulse-1:0.3.52-2 with wireplumber-0.4.10-3.
 I'm currently using discord-0.0.18-1 with BetterDiscord 1.5.3.
 The current kernel I'm using is Linux 5.18.2-260-tkg-bmq.

 When using 'java --version', theres only the jdk coming up but the jre is nowhere to be seen, is there a manual way of installing other than installing it through pacman. Also when installing the package it's only a few kb large which doesn't match the size I'm seeing on some websites.
 Could also be a different issue by the launcher itself as I'm getting:
 "terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::logic_error'

 But that is probably due to the jre missing.

 I recently installed arch on my laptop and noticed the wifi didn't work. After some research I've found that it was because the NetworkManager wasn't starting automatically when the computer boots up. For now I'm starting it manually with "sudo systemctl start NetworkManager" but I'd like to know how to make the NetworkManager start automatically.
 Also I found that the same thing happens with iwd but I don't know if it's useful to run both at the same time. If it is though I'd like to fix that as well.
