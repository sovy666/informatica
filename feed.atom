        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I switched to arch from ubuntu because of all the extra fluff it has. I used airblader’s i3-gaps wm (I’m looking to switch to bspwm for arch linux) and used polybar for a taskbar. I don’t think I have any need for a desktop environment, since I don’t need a “bundle” of stuff if I can somehow assemble all the individual parts I need together. 
 Are there alternatives to a desktop environment? I’m not sure exactly how I can get a gui to work without one. What other parts do I need? Guides seem scarce as it seems most people just install Gnome. 
 This is new ground for me. Sorry if I sound like a noob right now. Any help would be appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everything was working fine until I decided to try to play the original Colonization game on steam. When i tried to run it my monitors went black with an "out of range" message on it and it persists after rebooting. The SDDM animation displays as normal on boot but then when I'd normally get to the KDE desktop i get the black screens again. I was able to hear Firefox start playing a video due to random luck pressing buttons during the black screen, so i'm sure its running I think its just stuck in a display setting that isn't working.
 I've tried editing the kernel parameters and adding nomodeset, also tried specifying the resolution and refresh rate of my monitor there and it doesn't help. I've tried unplugging and plugging the monitors, booting with just one monitor connected, none of it has made a difference. Any suggestions on how to get back to my desktop? I'm using systemdboot and X11 if that makes any difference. Thanks.
 Edit: Finally fixed it. Booted with the kernel parameter 3 in order to boot to the command line and deleted everything in ~/.local/share/kscreen
 Now working after a reboot.

 If I play the music file an image shows up in mpv or vlc so i know the metadata is there. 
 Is it a configuration thing or a plugin thing? 
 I was hoping ranger_devicons-git would do it but it doesn't seem so.

 Wondering if you could provide some tips or pointers?
 My goal is to read through the Wiki for both power management and Hybrid setup. I'm trying to determine ahead of time what tools I might need.
 I'm running the mainline, upstream kernel (5.17), with btrfs (Post 5.0), and KDE with Powerdevil installed. What other tools might I require? acpid? laptop-mode-tools? any Gui?
 Can I set this up with GUI only? 
 Is there anything to be aware of when configuring? 
 What tools do you recommend?
 My laptop is Asus FA506IU Ryzen 4800H and 1660ti.
 Thanks in advance

Queste immagini “AI generate” possono poi essere usate, per esempio, in un sito di incontri per spacciarsi per una persona reale di bell’aspetto e tentare qualche truffa. Mi è così capitato di provare l’estensione, disponibile solo per Chrome e i browser basati su Chromium, Fake Profile Detector, sviluppata da V7 Labs, che è in grado di riconoscere le immagini fasulle generate usando il metodo StyleGAN. Al momento non è in grado di riconoscere fotomontaggi o video fasulli. Per maggiori informazioni potete vedere una dimostrazione del funzionamento dell’estensione in un video, in inglese, di Alberto Rizzoli, uno dei fondatori di V7 Lab.

 I find when I try to explain what these files are, why its important to care, and why users are expected to promptly deal with them as part of routine system maintenance in an Arch based rolling distro, people's eyes glaze over (probably has something to do with my use of exciting terms like "routine system maintenance" 😉)
 Does anyone have a good resource or good elevator pitch length explanation of what they are and why its important for Arch users to care.

The patch is live in the mainline kernel so I'd rather wait than recompile it myself, but for the time being I've been holding the power button down on my laptop to forcibly kill the power. Obviously this is less than ideal, so I was wondering what the safest way to perform this kind of power cycle is, short of removing the battery.

 The network admin recently blocked outgoing traffic on port 22. So I can't access Git repos through ssh. I couldn't get it to use Psiphon's localhost socks proxy.
 For Github I ended up following this guide to use the ssh.github.com:443 endpoint instead of github.com:22. https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/troubleshooting-ssh/using-ssh-over-the-https-port
 Is there something similar for AUR ssh? Are there any alternatives?

USENET has also been a witness to historical events such as the announcement of Linux and the first spam message.
    
With modern websites and social media, most people think that USENET is a dead place. This is not the case. Over the decades, hundreds of communities have continued to use USENET to discuss their interests. This article aims to show 7 USENET groups that are still alive and kicking today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Manhattan, azienda leader nello sviluppo di soluzioni tecnologicamente avanzate, presenta il nuovo cavo adattatore USB Type-C HDMI utile per collegare agevolmente dispositivi come smartphone, tablet e computer dotati di porta USB-C con uno schermo, monitor o proiettore HDMI senza richiedere l'utilizzo di un adattatore aggiuntivo. La soluzione proposta da Manhattan permette una connessione diretta, ordinata e professionale tra dispositivi ed è quindi ideale per l'home office, l'home theater e per qualunque situazione in cui vi sia l'esigenza di trasferire il segnale audio-video in modo semplice e veloce.Disponibile nelle lunghezze da 1 metro (modello IUSBC-HDMI-4-010) e da 2 metri (modello IUSBC-HDMI-4-020), il cavo adattatore da USB-C a HDMI di Manhattan supporta risoluzioni UHD (Ultra High-Definition) fino a 4K (3840 x 2160 pixel) a 60 Hz garantendo immagini ultra nitide e realistiche, senza sfocature o artefatti, con una qualità audio e video eccellenti.

Il versatile adattatore proposto da Manhattan è compatibile con qualsiasi dispositivo USB-C che supporta la funzionalità DisplayPort Alt Mode inclusi smartphone, Apple MacBook, Chromebook, Pixel e tablet.A differenza della maggior parte degli altri cavi DP Alt Mode che supportano solo 30 fps, il prodotto di Manhattan assicura prestazioni ai massimi livelli permettendo di gestire un frame rate fino a 60 fps, ideale quindi anche per il segmento gaming.La circuiteria utilizzata per il cavo adattatore è compatibile con la tecnologia Thunderbolt 3 e si mette in evidenza per la struttura a doppia schermatura a lamina e treccia in grado di ridurre al minimo le interferenze elettromagnetiche (EMI) così come tutte le altre fonti di interferenza.]]></summary>

Tor è anche un programma scritto in C che implementa i protocolli sia lato client che lato server.Nella nostra guida a Tor Browser abbiamo spiegato come funziona Tor e come la rete possa essere utilizzate anche per navigare anonimi.Il progetto Tor ha preso forma nel 2002 utilizzando come base i lavori in tema di Onion Routing della metà degli anni '90. Dal 2006 lo sviluppo di Tor è gestito da un ente senza scopo di lucro ed è cresciuto di anno in anno fino ad essere scelto ogni giorno da milioni di utenti in tutto il mondo.Oggi la comunità di sviluppo di Tor ha annunciato che entro settembre 2022 dovrebbe debuttare la prima versione stabile di Arti, un client non più scritto in C bensì in Rust.Rust è un linguaggio di programmazione compilato sviluppato da Mozilla Research in collaborazione con la comunità open source il cui obiettivo primario è quello di consentire la realizzazione di sistemi complessi altamente sicuri, anche multithreaded.L'attuale client multipiattaforma di Tor non morirà a breve ma in futuro verrà certamente accantonato.]]></summary>

Esistono software gratuiti come BrowsingHistoryView che recuperano la cronologia di qualunque browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Chromium e derivati) per qualsiasi account configurato su una macchina locale o remota.Per evitare di far sapere agli altri utenti cosa si sta cercando, si dovrebbe quindi usare sempre la navigazione in incognito del browser: in questo modo le pagine Web visitate e tutti gli elementi in esse presenti non saranno memorizzate né a livello di cronologia né di cache locale.Per 'spaccare il capello' ed evitare che altri soggetti possano risalire agli URL dei siti Web visitati anche nella modalità di navigazione in incognito è possibile attivare l'uso del protocollo DNS over HTTPS (DoH) che provvede a crittografare tutte le richieste di risoluzione dei nomi a dominio.]]></summary>

La società guidata da Lisa Su ha aggiunto che fornirà maggiori informazioni sulla questione 'il più presto possibile'.Il bug interessa soltanto i computer con una scheda grafica Radeon e un processore Ryzen: questi ultimi sono controllati tramite il software Adrenalin che integra una sorta di modulo software (Ryzen Master) utilizzato per modificare vari aspetti del funzionamento del processore senza dover entrare nel BIOS.Il tutto è governato dalla funzione chiamate Precision Boost Overdrive (PBO) che si occupa di regolare tensioni e frequenze 'al volo' per l'overclock con un semplice clic.L'overclocking automatico del processore causato dall'installazione del driver Adrenalin più aggiornato non è di per sé un grosso problema perché l'aumento delle frequenze operative appare piuttosto contenuto.]]></summary>

 You can play it as many times as your want, as long as you have a pc speaker on your motherboard. 🤣 
 There's two hooks running before and after every transaction, meaning it will be played before and after any time you install/update packages. 
 You could, in theory, replace your pacman binary with a custom script so you can play that EVERY TIME YOU RUN PACMAN.🤣 
 https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pacman-beep-hook. 
 Edit: The set up permission error is raised by beep when pacman is runned as root with sudo, but the hook erroring does not stop any installation/upgrading, the package is installed successfully anyway. 
 According to @EmbarrassedActive4, beep will refuse to work if you run pacman with sudo, you can simply run pacman as root or su -c 'pacman' to su to root and execute pacman in one go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 Posting this Firefox problem on r/Arch because that is the only instance where I experience this problem. That said, it may not be an Arch problem at all, but I had to start somewhere.
 ​
 The problem is that Firefox freezes frequently, and for sevaral seconds at a time, on one of my PCs. Active tab is frozen, and can't switch to any other. After several seconds a tab responds, and makes FF essentially useless. This happens only on one machine.
 ​
 I run Firefox on KDE. I have three instances:
 - Arch vfio VM w/nvidia
 - Fedora Spin vfio VM with custom repo for kde latest, w/nvidia
 - Arch on System76 laptop w/intel/nvida, using Optimus Manager in hybrid mode
 ​
 The two VMs are configured the same with all respects except for OS. I only run one or the other at a time. There are no tweaks applied to Firefox on any instance other than add-ons.
 ​
 The VMs are my daily drivers, and ideally it would be the Arch VM. But since Firefox is unusable essentially on that VM,I am using Fedora until I can solve this problem.
 ​
 Things that I have tried on the Arch VM:
 - reviewed the Arch Wiki entry for solutions
 - Safe mode
 - clear clache
 - move cache to ramdisk
 - create new profile
 - Remove FF and ~/.mozilla and /.cache/mozilla directories, reinstall and create a, new profile.
 After each of these changes, the freezing problem always returned at some point.
 ​
 I am out of ideas. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

 I sat down at my Arch desktop to find it near unusable last night. I upgraded packages on Sunday, but I didn't reboot the machine until the next morning (Monday morning). One of the things that was updated was the NVIDIA driver to 510.60.02 from 510.54. I believe this to be the culprit because I've read others are having issues with this driver, but I've downgraded all my NVIDIA packages ("nvidia", "nvidia-utils", lib32-nvidia-utils") back to the version before 510.60.2, and the issue persists.
 My machine sports an i7-6700, GTX 1070, 16GB RAM on an SSD. I've been running the 5.17.1 kernel since the day it was released in the main repo and was using the machine without incident until last night/upgrade on Sunday -- I don't think it's an issue with the new kernel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would consider myself a fairly sophisticated user, but I'm out of my depth here when it comes to kernel diagnostics.
 I am having random system crashes on startx, and sometimes on resume from suspend, and sometimes just during boot, but I don't know how to see what is happening or causing them. Also sometimes getting RO filesystem type crashes that may or may not be related.
 I've been doing the following:
 journalctl -b -r -p 1..4 > errors.md and looking for an insertion point for troubleshooting, but it's hard to say what is critical and what isn't without some deeper knowledge of how the kernel is working / supposed to work.
 Dell Precision 5550 only has USB-C inputs and most of the errors are not reproducible in some way that lends itself to easy diagnostics. I updated the BIOS last week and everything is up to date, but the crashes persist and instability persists, especially when there are devices connected to the USB-C ports.
 Is there somewhere else to look or something to be done before I just RMA the machine and use a desktop instead? Really some description of the process is what I'm looking for more than just "the answer", which I'm happy to put in the foot miles to get. I'll put the output of the journal log in the comments.
 I would think it was something I'm doing wrong except these problems sometimes happen during POST and I get multiple sequential reboots even before drive decrypt which makes me think I've got a hardware/firmware problem.

 "Disabling CONFIG_BPF_PRELOAD gets rid of those warnings. It seems to be a debug related option so disabling it makes sense while CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO is disabled at the same time."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A metà dello scorso anno l'azienda di Redmond ha presentato Windows 365 Cloud PC, un nuovo servizio che permette di eseguire installazioni di Windows 10 e Windows 11 da un browser Web, ovunque ci si trovi.Le installazioni dei sistemi operativi si trovano nell'infrastruttura cloud di Microsoft ed è possibile usare Windows come se fosse installato sul dispositivo locale.Citrix e molte altre aziende hanno offerto per anni strumenti simili ma l'obiettivo di Microsoft è quello di estendere la platea degli utenti facendo in modo che i sistemi Windows 11 possano avviarsi utilizzando l'installazione locale oppure effettuando il boot da Windows 365 Cloud PC.Gli utenti di Windows 11 potranno passare liberamente dall'una all'altra installazione, in totale libertà.La novità presentata da Microsoft si inquadra nel ventaglio di iniziative promosse dalla società guidata da Satya Nadella per supportare le aziende che si appoggiando allo smart working.


Windows 365 Cloud PC si lega con Windows 11: ecco le tre nuove caratteristiche
 I portavoce di Microsoft spiegano che alcune nuove caratteristiche di Windows 365 saranno profondamente integrate in Windows 11.La prima si chiama Windows 365 Boot e consentirà ai dispositivi Windows 11, come accennato in precedenza, di accedere direttamente a un'istanza Cloud PC all'avvio invece di eseguire l'installazione locale del sistema operativo.Si tratta di una funzionalità progettata per i dispositivi che sono condivisi tra più persone o per le aziende che permettono ai dipendenti di portare il proprio dispositivo al lavoro (approccio BYOD, Bring your own device).Con Windows 365 Switch gli utenti potranno passare da un desktop locale a un PC Cloud senza abbandonare Windows 11.]]></summary>

But do you really need to use these paid services when you’re just starting out? We recommend investing in a professionally-created logo after you have landed a few clients.
    
For now, instead of paying for a logo, you can design a simple logo yourself for free using Google Drawings. We show you how to do that and the prep work you need to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Selezionare il monitor per PC più adatto alle proprie esigenze è uno degli aspetti che viene più spesso trascurato. Quante volte si aggiorna la configurazione hardware del PC o si procede a una completa sostituzione del computer ma si continua a lavorare con il vecchio monitor ormai non più al passo coi tempi? Eppure il monitor del PC è lo strumento con cui si è maggiormente a contatto, tutti i giorni: acquistare un monitor qualità significa facilitare la lettura e diminuire significativamente lo stress visivo.Scegliere un monitor per PC può però rivelarsi cosa terribilmente complicata: spesso è difficile scegliere i prodotti che meglio si adattano alle proprie esigenze e aspettative.Se avete spesso gli occhi stanchi è bene scegliere bene il monitor per PC, posizionarlo correttamente e, talvolta, fare attenzione anche all'uso di temi scuri che non sono - diversamente da quello che scrivono in tanti - la soluzione per tutti i mali.
Monitor PC: le caratteristiche del pannello
 I monitor per PC che trovate ad esempio su Amazon Italia possono utilizzare svariate tecnologie.In generale, però, si ha a che fare con monitor a pannello TFT (Thin Film Transistor) composti da un substrato di materiale semiconduttore trasparente depositato sulle superfici interne dei vetri che ospitano anche i cristalli liquidi.La specifica tecnologia utilizzabile per fabbricare il pannello del monitor può invece fare capo a diverse categorie ma generalmente i monitor per PC sono di tre tipologie: TN (Twisted Nematic), IPS (In Plane Switching) o VA (Vertical Alignment).I termini TN, IPS e VA tendono a passare inosservati tra le specifiche dei monitor quando invece la tecnologia realizzativa dei pannelli è la chiave per scegliere prodotti di qualità.
I pannelli TN
 I pannelli di tipo TN esistono da tanti anni.]]></summary>

The first time I rebooted everything went fine but after the second boot, the first drive I added could not mount. It still showed up in the file manager but was not accessible when I tried to open it. It gave me a short error saying something went wrong and this is an unknown error when I tried to mount it myself. After a restart, everything worked fine again but after rebooting I noticed a pattern. The same drive gives the same mounting error every other time I boot my machine. The other drive never makes any issue. What's happening?
