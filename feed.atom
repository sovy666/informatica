        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After having the issue plague me for 5 months, I finally figured out the fix. The issue is that monitors by default uses automatic settings for its Broadcast RGB Range where sometime it's incorrectly set to Limited Broadcast RGB Range (16-235 instead of 0-255, more info here) resulting in washed out colours making the deepest black looking greyish and white not as bright etc. In my case, it's because I'm using Intel iGPU (laptop) with an external monitor connected via HDMI to USB C thunderbolt port.
 ​
 The solution is easy on xorg with xrandr:
 xrandr --output auto --set "Broadcast RGB" "Full" 
 ​
 For Wayland there wasn't much info online so it was quite difficult to find the solution: Use (libdrm) proptest to overide 'Broadcast RGB' from automatic (0) to full (1) for your specific monit…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This was my setup which was working fine
 UEFI (Gigabyte x570 Aorus Pro Wifi) PCIe 1: Nvidia card (vfio-pci) - connected to HDMI PCIe 2: AMD card (amdgpu) - connected to DP-1 kernel: vfio-pci.ids=<...> nvidia-drm.modeset=0 nouveau.modeset=0 modprobe.blacklist=nouveau,nvidia,nvidia_uvm,nvidia_drm,nvidia_modeset UEFI Primary display: card 2 
 This worked fine and when my bootloader loaded the arch EFI entry, the display would be on card 2.
 However I've recently swapped out card one for another AMD card (which i've bound instead to vfio-pci), however whenever loading the arch EFI entry, it will default to card 1 and load the framebuffer onto it. It naturally wont load Xorg as the driver is bound to vfio-pci. I don't get any output on card 2 once UEFI has handed over to the arch EFI image.
 How can I force the early arch boot process to use card 2 and ignore card 1? 
 I tried setting video=DP-1:e in the kernel cmd line as per https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kernel_mode_setting but it did not help.

 I'm using an AMD RX 5700 GPU and followed all the necessary steps to get hardware video acceleration working in general.
 Then I installed the obs-gstreamer plugin, gstreamer-vaaapi and ffmpeg-obs which comes with --enable-vaaapi.
 In OBS I choose the GStreamer Encoder (VA-API) and tried to simply record my whole desktop. But the video quality is really horrible as you can see here and sometimes even flickers weirdly: https://imgur.com/wCPUpSu
 What am I missing? Is there a bug or any other error with my GPU drivers? Or have I set something up the wrong way?
 Using the usual libx264 encoder works fine, btw.

Luckily, there are a bunch of streaming video platforms that offer quality content for free. All of the services listed below are 100% legal and free of charge.

 Why am I getting these when running 'timedatectl set-ntp true' during the beginning of the installation? I'm not even using a virtualbox, but actually installing on my desktop. 
 Don't remember ever encountering this in the past.
 Is this something I should be concern about?
 timedatectl set-ntp true did seem to do its job - i checked with 'timedatectl status'
 But why did i receive that timeout/depend error message though?

 Even changing to a resolution that is not 1920x1080 gives me the same error, any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a Wyse thin client that is running arch linux. I need to set up a mount point to an Unraid server I have running on a computer on the same network (my home one). I am relatively new to all this, and am having difficulty finding a decent guide to how to do that in the most direct and simple way. I know that samba is used to connect to Windows computers, but I am also seeing things that indicate I should use an NFS connection of some sort and edit the fstab file. If I know that my Unraid server is at xxx.xxx.x.xxx, what is the mount command (or sequence of commands) I should use? Again, I'm very new to this, so please be patient with me!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a precautionary measure, people and organizations hide their Wi-Fi networks, especially when it isn’t for public use. They choose not to broadcast the SSID so that when people turn on their Wi-Fi, it doesn’t appear on the list of available networks to connect to. Your best friend might hide their Wi-Fi network from their roommate and others in their building, but that also locks you out. This tutorial shows you how to connect to hidden Wi-Fi networks via the taskbar and Windows settings.

It has a Rockchip RK3568B2 ARM Cortex-A55n ARM processor. I am struggling with what OS to put on it. Obviously I cannot put Arch proper on it because it is an ARM architecture, but I really like Arch because the packages tend to be up to date and it is easy to package new software and add it to a local repository. My only experience with ARM devices are some old Raspberry Pis running Raspbian and a couple of old routers running OpenWrt. Most of my x86 systems run Arch although I have to support a couple of sytems that run Debian. 
 I guess I am thinking between Debian, Arch and OpenWRT. What distro would you choose?

 Very unsurprsingly it took me few good reinstall and scouring through the internet
 Unsurprisingly I'm using KDE(wayland) and I really wanted to try i3 so it's KDE+i3
 ​
 I followed 2 videos and my intuition with archinstall:
 muta's arch linux build
 LearnLinuxTv - how to install arch linux full guide
 ​
 shame with both of these, I could not get the last step of installing just plasma and going with it
 so after trying for a good few days, i went with archinstall and knowledge from installing with their techniques, it was SO EASY!
 ​
 Now, I will set my KDE environment as minimal. All the suggestions are welcome.
 I hope y'all have a great day ahead!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am kinda stumped on this problem, and I am hoping someone here can provide some guidance.
 Booting installation media with UEFI, and when I try to select the option to start the installation the screen goes black and nothing else comes up. On my hard drives I have a broken Ubuntu system and a Windows system that was working until I installed amd graphics drivers for my new gpu. I used an nvidia gpu prior.
 I initially tried re-installing windows, but the windows installation media does not work either. I had been meaning to install arch back on my pc, so I figured this was a good time. However the arch installation media does not work either.
 I am aware of the grub kernel parameters and kernal mode settings, but I do not have much experience with them. It seems people have had this problem before and the solution is to add "nomodeset" as a kernel parameter. This however does nothing for me. The screen continues to go black after adding new valid and invalid parameters.
 I have also tried running the installation media with a BIOS boot, but my keyboards do not work in the arch menu for bios boot. I have a fancy keyboard and an old basic keyboard that always works when the fancy one does not.

Amazon ha annunciato oggi che Drive chiuderà i battenti alla fine del 2023.Presentato come servizio di archiviazione cloud sicuro per i clienti Amazon al fine di effettuare il backup dei propri file, Drive offre 5 GB di spazio gratis per tutti gli utenti e la possibilità di accedere da Web oltre che tramite app Android e iOS.L'abbandono di Amazon Drive si concretizzerà attraverso una serie di tappe successive: il 31 ottobre 2022 Amazon rimuoverà le app Drive dagli store di Google ed Apple mentre dal 31 gennaio 2023 non saranno più accettati nuovi caricamenti di file sul cloud. Dal 31 dicembre 2023 gli utenti di Amazon Drive non potranno più visualizzare o scaricare i contenuti conservati sui server dell'azienda guidata da Jeff Bezos.Amazon suggerisce a tutti coloro che si servono del servizio Drive di scaricare i dati in locale prima di questa data limite.Nel caso in cui gli utenti dovessero incontrare difficoltà nel download di file pesanti oppure di un gran numero di elementi memorizzati su Amazon Drive, i tecnici della società suggeriscono di ricorrere al client desktop di Amazon Photos: esso consente di scaricare più di 5 GB o 1.000 file per volta.L'abbandono di Amazon Drive non avrà alcun effetto su Amazon Photos, il servizio che consente di archiviare sul cloud foto e video.Per gli abbonati Amazon Prime è assicurato il caricamento di un numero illimitato di foto, di qualunque peso e con qualsiasi risoluzione.Per approfondire, Amazon ha pubblicato una pagina contenente le risposte alle domande frequenti sulla chiusura di Drive e le istruzioni per recuperare per tempo i propri dati..]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Now that Firefox 103.0 has just been released, people are everywhere asking when it will be coming to their distribution.
 In Arch it already is, but I always wonder how they do things.
 In my case I have tried other distributions, like Tumbleweed, Fedora or LMDE, and I have always found more problems in those distributions than in Arch.
 Distributions that, in theory, should be more stable, since they do not publish updates until their programs are well tested, so I wonder how they do things in Arch so that, in my case, I hardly get problems with the latest versions of the programs, while in the others always appears something (Firefox....Plasma....Dolphin ...) that usually gives some other program.
 It is true that I like to keep my system with very few packages installed and I hardly use anything from AUR but, for example, no matter how minimalist I make the installation of Tumbleweed (as its installer allows it) I always end up having problems, usually small problems, it is true, but they do not appear in Arch.
 Does anyone else usually have less problems with Arch packages, even if they are more up to date than the other distributions?

Il fatto è che trovare prodotti che sappiano coniugare la qualità con il prezzo non è affatto semplice.La bici elettrica pieghevole NIUBILITY B16 con motore da 350W, 36V, batteria da 10,4 Ah e velocità massima pari a 25 km/h è un prodotto davvero molto interessante, peraltro realizzato da un'azienda da anni specializzata in questa tipologia di oggetti.NIUBILITY B16 è disponibile al prezzo scontato di 479,99 euro con spedizione dai magazzini europei del venditore. Per ottenere lo sconto promozionale è necessario digitare il codice coupon TCNYTB al momento dell'invio dell'ordine.

Realizzata in lega di alluminio, NIUBILITY B16 pesa circa 20 kg, dispone di ruote stabili da 16 pollici e misura 137 x 24 x 113 cm una volta aperta (78 x 35 x 65 cm quando ripiegata su se stessa).NIUBILITY B16 può essere utilizzata in due diverse modalità tra le quali c'è anche la pedalata assistita.Stando a quanto dichiarato dal produttore, la batteria da 10,4 Ah offre un'autonomia di circa 40-50 km con una singola ricarica (che richiede 4-6 ore).Il motore elettrico brushless da 350W è silenzioso e, grazie alla sua posizione, offre un ottimo bilanciamento della bici contribuendo ad assicurare una stabilità ancora maggiore.]]></summary>

 For anyone think remove it using the gui file manager i am not going to do that because i want to know why rm is not doing what i am saying it to do
