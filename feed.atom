        <updated>2022-04-27T20:25:44.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I should preface this by saying that I'm still pretty new to all this, and feeling somewhat overwhelmed by what is a pretty big black box to me.
 Up until just recently, my laptop's cpu temperature was running up to the mid 60s on idle and I'm not entirely sure why. I've done powertop --auto-tune as outlined in the wiki and it somehow managed to make the temperature worse (over 70C), which I can assume leads to a worse battery life.
 On top of all this, the temperature control seems to sometimes work well on power supply. The fan kicks on around 55C and runs until the temperature hits 50C, which I think is pretty ideal (similar to what I'm seeing on Windows at least). That only appears to be true on power supply though, because when I just unplugged it, the temperature shot up to 65C and remains there. I'm not hearing the fan speed up to compensate the rising temperature either.
 The power drain is still horrible.
 I assume there is some information I can provide that would help diagnose whatever is going on here. Please let me know what that is.
 At the very least, I can tell you some system info:
 OS: Arch Linux x86_64
 Host: XENIA 15 M37957-404
 Kernel: 5.17.4-arch1-1
 CPU: 11th Gen Intel i7-11800H (16) @ 4.600GHz
 GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Mobile / Max-Q 
 GPU: Intel TigerLake-H GT1 [UHD Graphics]
 Right now I'm on the Intel GPU.
 Edit: Okay, so I thought about it makes sense that the fan is less aggressive on battery. The heat produced by the cpu is still there; the fan just pushes it elsewhere. In other words, it's sucking power either way. Saying that, the underlying issue is to figure out what's turned on that doesn't need to be, maybe?
 Thank you for any advice anyone can offer. I'm incredibly confused.

It's currently using pipewire with the necessary pipewire-* packages installed but i'm running in a weird bug where sound fades out after a couple of seconds of playback (like cutting the low frequencies and then there's nothing left at all). Sound is back after a few seconds but the bug comes back again and so on. Do you guys have any ideas? I have a realtek alc294 audio card, I tried a bunch of fixes but nothing is working.

Le versioni LTS possono inoltre beneficiare del supporto ESM (Extended Security Maintenance) col quale viene assicurata la disponibilità degli aggiornamenti di sicurezza per ulteriori 5 anni. Di fatto, quindi, una release LTS di Ubuntu viene abbandonata a 10 anni dalla pubblicazione.Indipendentemente dall'uso che se ne farà, ad esempio su un server locale o sul cloud, nel caso di Ubuntu ci si dovrebbe sempre orientare su una release LTS in modo da assicurarsi pieno supporto esteso nel tempo.L'aspetto…]]></summary>

Apple, Google, et al., Responsible for Stolen Data
    
A new report shows that Apple, Alphabet (parent company of Google), Twitter, Snap Inc., Meta (parent company of Facebook and Instagram), and Discord have all given sensitive information belonging to children to hackers.
    
This stolen data was used by the hackers to access the young victims’ accounts and force them into sexual exploitation. Federal law enforcement and investigators said the information was obtained through fake legal requests, which the tech companies honored.

La nuova impostazione di Google, che diventa obbligatoria per tutti gli sviluppatori interessati a pubblicare le loro app sul Play Store, prevede anche l'aggiunta di una chiara indicazione sui dati condivisi con terze parti.

Toccando o cliccando su una specifica voce, l'utente può controllare con cura tutti i dati che l'applicazione raccoglie.In una terza sezione Google Play Store chiarisce se gli utenti hanno la possibilità di chiedere la cancellazione dei dati in qualsiasi momento.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This weekend I installed arch linux. first time installing with tty, happy that it works other than the fps issues, I did try a few things. 
 my laptop specs are 9300h, nvidia 1650 M and integrated graphics so it comes with optimus.
 I installed nvidia, nvidia-utils, nvidia-settings and nvidia-prime for drivers and for gui, I got xorg, xorg-xinit and qtile then went on .xinitrc and added exec qtile start and nothing else basically with regards to drivers or display server, I just ran startx after login every time I use my laptop, I plan to use login manager later
 For the 2 games I play, both of which have native linux support. I do prime-run osu-lazer or use prime-run launch options in csgo
 thing is the fps is way lower than expected, my friend with the same hardware gets 2000 to 2500 fps on osu-lazer and gets 220-250 fps in csgo, while I get 200 to 400 for osu-lazer and 30-60 on csgo. he uses pop_os! which has it's own optimus manager built in.
 he does have an external monitor BUT his fps is the same with laptop monitor or external monitor. 
 so I did the obvious thing and tried the optimus manager, from the aur, 
 I did optimus-manger --switch nvidia but got an error with "latest gpu setup attempt failed at xorg pre-start hook" 
 searching online running prime-offload command before switching using optimus manager helps, which actually worked and I ran the optimus-manager --switch nvidia command without errors but this led to me having even lower fps than prime-run for osu-lazer and I didn't test this for csgo. 
 I thought before I try the other options in arch wiki for optimus systems, there must be something I am doing wrong for my situation and wanted help. 
 if I can't fix this I am considering dual booting pop_os! along arch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[L'emulatore di Android messo a disposizione da Google è sicuramente il migliore che possiamo trovare dato che quasi ogni app rilasciata sul PlayStore è stata molto probabilmente testata proprio su questo programma. Di solito fa parte della suite Android Studio che contiene tutti i componenti e i programmi necessari per creare app per Android ma se vogliamo solo l'emulatore e poco altro è possibile averlo senza per forza installare tutta la suite. Dato che sarà un installazione minimale, dovremo utilizzare la linea di comando per configurare e avviare l'emulatore, il che non è affatto un male perché questo metodo di interazione con il computer è uno dei più efficienti che ci sia!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Windows devices have a variety of system and app notifications (sometimes incorrectly called program pop-ups) that alert you about events happening in real time. Be it incoming VoIP calls, Outlook calendar reminders, or frequent prompts for a Windows version update, they might all seem equally urgent.
    
However that’s not always the case; and even if it were, any user action required from you can easily wait a bit longer. Notifications can be especially annoying when you’re hard at work or enjoying your favorite game or TV show.
    
To stop these alerts from being intrusive, we recommend disabling them, hiding them temporarily, or enabling only the important ones. We’ll show you how to do disable computer notifications on Windows.

I have installed mopidy and mopidy-mpd and configured it as the docs says but when I start ncmpcpp it says 'connection refused', but then, if I start ncpmcpp as sudo or with the flag -h 127.0.0.1 (Host which ncmpcpp should supposedly already connect because I have it like that in the config files) it connects, but the sound has a lot of latency, like one to two seconds (which I suspect it has to do with pipewire but idk), for example when I try to lower the volume it lags and two secones later it lowers the volume... I would really appreciate your help as I would like to set up mopidy-spotify later down the line. Thanks for reading!!

 Or maybe they got a new printer so don't care about it any more. Often you will see a note on the aur comments if a maintainer is abandoning a package though.
 Any other clues as to whether I should try this one or repackage myself?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Installing XFCE with archinstall, I can see only two icon sets present: Adwaita and HighContrast. I think Adwaita icons look good enough, but the problem is that it lacks a lot of icons for WhiskerMenu or the default image viewer tool bar. If I set the icon set to "HighContrast", all those missing icons are displayed, but the high contrast icons look ugly. I have tested it with EndeavourOS and its default icon set was Qogir. If I change it to Adwaita, I can see missing icons there, too.
 I think I could find some different icon sets from the Internet, but I think the default Adwaita looks good enough. Can I keep Adwaita and add missing icons? Or using another icon set is the sane solution?

Its storage mechanism operates under the same principles that other flash storage mediums use, namely non-volatile memory, which prevents memory from disappearing due to loss of power like it does in RAM. Since both SD cards and SSDs use solid-state storage and have no moving parts, is there any notable difference between the two types of memory? Shouldn’t a massive-capacity SD card be just about the same thing as a small SSD?
