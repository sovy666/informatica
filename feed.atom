        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've tried installing arch ~5 times using archinstall and 2 times manually. I'm using an NVIDIA RTX3050 mobile so that's probably the culprit.
 Xorg logs don't show anything peculiar. Journalctl also shows completely normal logs. Using nvidia-xconfig does nothing. Deleting /etc/X11/xorg.conf does nothing. Deleting the entire /etc/X11/xorg.d/ does nothing. Following the wiki about using an NVIDIA card for everything without care of power does nothing. (did everything word for word as was suggested in the wiki 2 times with no luck).
 Anyway, doing startx freezes my laptop and the fans ramp up. I also tried just leaving it like that for an hour with no change. Only the poweroff button has any effect (shell complains that it doesn't understand the input). I still couldn't get any inputs in. For example, ctrl+alt+fx did nothing.
 I've installed arch ~10 times in virtual machines and different desktops and laptops. I've used arch for years and I've never seen anything like this. Google doesn't give any helpful results either. I tried every possible fix the first two google pages recommended. I've never dealt with NVIDIA cards so I believe this is something exclusive to them.
 Also, I'm using an Acer Nitro 5 with an RTX3050 and an 11th gen i5 CPU if that has anything to do with this issue.
 If anyone has a fix or could help me, please let me know. I would hate to install an inferior, glowing operating system to my laptop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A inizio 2018 la scoperta di alcune vulnerabilità di sicurezza battezzate Spectre e Meltdown ha fatto da apripista per i successivi attacchi side channel che fanno leva su tutta una serie di debolezze delle moderne CPU. Queste lacune di sicurezza hanno portato i ricercatori a intensificare gli studi sul funzionamento dei processori: negli anni seguenti sono infatti venute a galla molteplici vulnerabilità alle quali i produttori hardware e software hanno risposto in maniera differente.Sono state infatti realizzate patch che agiscono a livello di microcodice, kernel, driver, sistema operativo e persino lato applicativo per ridurre al minimo la superficie di attacco.In mancanza delle patch correttive, un aggressore che interagisce con i meccanismi di branch prediction della CPU o misura il tempo di esecuzione delle istruzioni in alcuni casi può recuperare dati personali e informazioni riservate, comprese password e chiavi di decodifica.Per lungo tempo (e in parte ancora oggi) gli attacchi come Spectre, Meltdown così come tutte le varianti successivamente emerse, sono stati considerati di grande interesse ma di scarsa valenza pratica.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Uno dei sistemi operativi Microsoft che hanno riscosso meno successo in assoluto è Windows 8.x. Con Windows 8.1, rilasciato a ottobre 2013, l'azienda di Redmond ha provato a porre rimedio a quei grossolani errori compiuti con Windows 8 circa un anno prima. Tra gli 'svarioni' più madornali ricordiamo la decisione di accantonare il tradizionale menu Start per guardare a un menu a tutto schermo progettato in primis per i dispositivi dotati di display touch. Nel 2012 l'interfaccia touch non era matura e non c'erano abbastanza dispositivi in grado di supportarla così la nuova impostazione introdotta con Windows 8 diventò rapidamente invisa alla maggior parte degli utenti.Sebbene con Windows 8.1 Microsoft abbia compiuto un deciso passo indietro, il sistema operativo non ha mai conquistato il favore degli utenti che hanno preferito restare con Windows 7 e, successivamente, a partire dal 2015, valutare la migrazione a Windows 10. Proprio l'anno scorso abbiamo detto perché Windows 10 è destinato a diventare il nuovo Windows 7.Windows 8.x non ha mai 'primeggiato' in termini di quote di mercato ma sui PC più vecchi sono ancora un buon numero gli utenti che utilizzano Windows 8.1, sistema operativo verrà ritirato da Microsoft il 10 gennaio 2023.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've done a few things that are relevant here to my Arch install:
  
Enabled Secure Boot through sbctl
 Reinstalled with Full Disk Encryption
 Enabled TPM + TPM pin for the above mentioned encryption
 Added SystemD hooks to the initrd
 Enabled Unified Kernel Image through sbctl's bundle feature
 Added plymouth
 Created /home partition
  
The systemd and plymouth hooks are systemd sd-encrypt sd-plymouth.
 Everything works PERFECTLY, except this one flaw:
 When I boot up my system, I need to enter my password twice. Once for the root partition and once for /home (Keep in mind they are both TPM pins, added using systemd-cryptenroll --tpm2-with-pin=yes).
 Here the Tip: mentions that it is cached in the kernel keyring, but it doesn't do anything for me.

 So I am quite puzzeled by this. I'm trying to install Arch on an Intel NUC. The USB stick doesn't get recognized when I boot the machine. Only when I switch to legacy BIOS mode it works, but I don't want that.
 When I use the stick in a different machine, it works. I have also tried several different sticks to no luck.
 ALSO, when I burn a diffrent iso like tails linux it works fine in UEFI mode. This is weird, isnt it? There is something about my specific combination of this NUC and the archiso.
 Any ideas how I could solve this?

If you’re someone who wants to revisit yesteryear and feed your nostalgia with and relive the era of button mashing and pinpoint platforming, you may be tempted to make your own retro gaming set-up. This can be a done a number of ways. You can use your PC to run emulators or you can grab one a single board computer like the Raspberry Pi to run RetroPie or Recalbox. The only issue you may face is, where do you get your hands on the games (legally)?

 What's even weirder is when I start lightdm manually it works perfectly. What is happening here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In iOS/iPadOS 15, users were limited to only a handful of customization options for the Lock Screen on the iPhone and iPad. While changing the wallpaper could add a personal touch, the overall date and time layout has maintained the same stale aesthetic since iOS 7 debuted back in 2013.
    
Coming later this year iOS 16 offers a complete overhaul of the Lock Screen experience featuring all-new widgets, font styles, and a Lock Screen gallery to help users easily switch between Lock Screen setups they have already configured. This article demonstrates how you can start using your Lock Screen’s customization options in iOS 15, and also offers a sneak peek at iOS 16.

 My current theory is that Arch shuts down "too fast". I have used Linux Desktops before, and although their shutdown was way faster than Windows', it wasn't quite as instantaneous as it is now.

A darne notizia è il ricercatore Maxime Ingrao che certifica la scoperta di 8 applicazioni pubblicate sul Play Store contenenti codice dannoso.Le applicazioni indicate con la 'X' rossa in questo tweet sono state rimosse da Google ma due di esse continuano ad oggi a essere presenti nello store ufficiale di Android.Il ricercatore spiega che il codice nascosto nelle varie app non utilizza il componente di sistema WebView per effettuare il rendering di contenuti remoti ma effettua una serie di richieste dirette via HTTP/HTTPS per non destare particolari sospetti.Il malware, battezzato Autolycos, provvede a iscrivere gli utenti malcapitati che installano le app Android dannose a servizi a valore aggiunto portando ad addebiti indesiderati.Le app malevole richiedono infatti all'utente il permesso di accesso al contenuto degli SMS memorizzati nello smartphone in modo da raccogliere tutte le informazioni che servono per condurre l'aggressione.Ingrao spiega che gli autori della campagna malware sono stati molto abili: le recensioni degli utenti che criticano il comportamento dell'app essendosi accorti di indizi sospetti si perdono tra le molteplici recensioni pubblicati sul Play Store mediante l'utilizzo di bot.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had an Arch Linux machine running on Google Cloud. I was running low on space and needed to expand the disk. The single disk on the machine was under /dev/sda and my data partition was /dev/sda2.
 I was following the instruction on https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/resize-persistent-disk. I messed up on the step that says:
 "Move GPT data structures to the end of the disk to align the GPT table."
 Instead of doing:
 sudo sgdisk --move-second-header /dev/sda 
 I did:
 sudo sgdisk --move-second-header /dev/sda2 
 The system froze. I mounted the disk to another instance to see what it looks like now and if I do df -h I get this things for the broken disk:
 /dev/sda15 124M 5.9M 118M 5% /boot/efi 
 Is there a way to get some data back from the old disk? I don't care to have the old system up and running, I just need to unearth some files, whatever I can.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I got a new laptop for work whith the with a 5800H (with some Vega graphics) and a 6600m dgpu,it is the HP Omen 16 from 2021. In short, it's this one
 This laptop has 1080@144hz (non-primary display) and is connected via HDMI to an external screen also 1080@144hz (primary display, right of laptop display). All of these using a X11 session.
 After tackling some issues with the driver config (external screen being unresponsive, system freezing etc) I face these two minor issues:
  
1. System seems to never shut down the screens after the set inactivity time. Using the amdgpu driver, system stays in the lock screen forever. If using the modesetting driver, screens turn on again automatically seconds after being shut down.
 2. After unlocking, all windows are moved to the laptop display and its extremely annoying due to the number of apps that I have opened at any given time during work.
  
I have spent a couple of days trying to find a solution, but no luck. Also, since I'm not really an expert on these matters I'm not really sure which info should I post here so:
 Xorg.0.log
 lspci -k
 ​
 cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-gpu.conf
 Section "Device" Identifier "6600m" Driver "amdgpu" BusID "PCI:3:0:0" Option "TearFree" "true" Option "DRI" "3" EndSection 
 cat /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-amdgpu.conf
 Section "OutputClass" Identifier "AMDgpu" MatchDriver "amdgpu" Driver "amdgpu" EndSection 
 I can provide any other info that might be useful.
 Any assistance will be very appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I received a pair of Sony WH-1000XM4s yesterday. I wanted to pair them with my Arch desktop, so that I could use LDAC to get the full capability out of these things.
 I've previously owned the WH-XB900N headphones, and those also support LDAC. Pipewire thankfully makes LDAC pretty easy, and I didn't have any issues with those.
 When I paired the headphones to my arch install, it ONLY shows the Headset HSP/HFP profiles. No High Fidelity audio options. The mic is on, and the headphones are stuck in headset mode.
 I've tried everything, and I cannot get it to go into an A2DP mode. I've unpaired and repaired them over and over, I've factory reset the headphones, updated pipewire, and tried to use the command line to force the audio profile. Nothing. 
 I connected my WH-XB900Ns, and they immediately connected via LDAC, and showed a whole host of other codec options.
 Weirdly, when I put them into simultaneous device mode, where two devices can be connected at the same time (but also disables LDAC), it works, and I can use AAC to listen to audio.
 I tried pairing them to my Mac, and they connected via AAC just fine, without being in simultaneous device mode. The issue seems isolated to my arch install.
 Pulling my hair out over this, would appreciate any guidance.
