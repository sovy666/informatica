 Right now i've gotten a new laptop (ZephyrusG14) and insalled arch, i use awesomeWM. 
 The problem i'm having is that when a i load X11, awesome does not show any icon and if i try to launch ulauncher, "nitrogen --restore" or any kind of explorer window (i.e. open file on chromium) it chrashes and does nothing.
 Both ulauncher and Nitrogen give a mesage regarding PixBuff:
 Nitrogen:

I've done a few installations on virtual machines, so I'm familiar with the normal process.

 I've looked around for answers but I'm still not sure, and I want to be absolutely certain before trying anything.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Installing was effortless with archinstall script, picked Gnome as desktop. Everything left at default and went smoothly, normal kernel.
 These were my first 5 minutes into it:
 - Opening a terminal, keyboard layout is not the one I just set at install time
 - Gnome settings open just fine but wallpaper changer doesn't work. Theme changer from light to dark isn't working either.
 - I try launching Gnome Tweaks from the Gnome Launche but it doesn't launch anything.
 - I go back to the Terminal to at least enlarge the font, however the 'Custom font' checkbox isn't working at all, despite being clickable.
 - I try to document all of this for a friend but the Gnome recorder (CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+R) stops recording at random in the first 10 seconds
 - Trying to "Pin to dash" Terminal doesn't actually pin anything
 Nothing of this is important but sets the mood for everything else, pretty much leaves me wondering what else could be broken and made me instantly drop my idea about switching to Arch in my main rig. The iso used was archlinux-2022.04.05-x86_64.iso
 New user experience aside, what could be causing all of this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, let's give some details (or rather, all the details I can afford to give).
 Basically, last night I updated my install (yes, using sudo pacman -Syu and I do update it somewhat often btw) before turning off my PC and everything seemed to work. Yet, now in the next day, I can enter the grub, yes, but after selecting to boot Arch (be it the Linux Kernel or the Linux-Zen one) and it seems to load normally but then it simply remains pitch black. And no, it's not just the graphical user interface, I can't bring the terminal up either.
 So, I tried using my installation media on a stick to repair, but weirdly it doesn't seem to boot either. I can select it from the boot menu on the bios, and it does boot into the "options" (install UEFI, install UEFI with voice, RAM etc.) but it doesn't matter what I select, it too seems to fail to boot.
 I am no "arch newbie", been using it for a year or so now, but I am really lost here, I suspect (but I hope it's not) something hardware-related at this point
 EDIT: Update, was able to enter the installation media by booting it on legacy mode and using the load into RAM option
 EDIT2: Ok, was able to chroot by doing so, updated the system once again via sudo pacman -Syu something with a package called libvterm broke but now it's fixed. Install repaired, problem solved. Feel free to point out to this thread as a possible solution for others.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I just set up an Arch server that will have some VMs permanently running on it.
 ​
 I thought that shutting down the host would gracefully handle the VMs but i don't think it does, as soon as I pass the shutdown -h now command, the VM networks drop (I am pinging to check).
 ​
 Then, after I reboot the host, the VMs go through a full boot. I think the system is just forcing the VMs off, the whole process feels way too fast.
 ​
 I found the libvirt-guests.service in the Wiki, but there is no mention of how to use it and the /etc/conf.d/libvirt-guests file that it says to read does not exist.
 ​
 Can I have some help on this please? Thank you!

 Does anyone know what's going on? Is the Arch team on vacation? Does this have something to do with the reports of web servers being down? Something else?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys! 
 Question about installing Arch Linux. I own an HP Pavilion Aero 13 laptop. Here is my configuration:
 Model: 13-be0006ur
 CPU: Ryzen 5 5600U (15W)
 RAM: 16GB
 SSD: 512GB
 Display: 13" IPS 2560x1600
 WiFi: Realtek 8852AE
 When installing Arch Linux, it is not possible to connect to Wi-Fi because there is no driver for Realtek 8852AE. There is no Ethernet port and the iPhone is used as a modem via USB. But Arch Linux doesn't see the iPhone, as far as I know, because when connecting via USB the iPhone needs to use iTunes as a modem. Can you tell me how to install the driver then and install Arch Linux? Do I need to look for an Android phone? I'm confused and can't solve this problem. I would appreciate your help!

 If so where should it go? I can't tell from the wording if it is saying that it is already added or that you should do it yourself if you want it to skip. If the latter how do I add it? Direct to the PKGBUILD rather than separate file? If so where?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[my secondary LDM hard drive was working fine after i had my friend help me mount it. for some reason now the mount stopped working, now it doesn't show anything. like the folder is still there, but there's nothing in it and umount tells me it's not mounted in the first place.
 ​
 mounting it gives me wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb1, missing codepage or helper program, or other error. i fixed it once by completely shutting of my windows partition, but i didn't touch it ever since i first mounted the drive. no luck searching stuff. any help?
 ​
 tldr: LDM mount no worky anymore how fix?
 edit: Microsoft LDM Partition is the full name thought there was only one LDM :/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had to drop back to Fedora this past week because I can't connect my preferred Bluetooth headphones under Arch (an MPOW BH408 receiver that I'm using while I wait for a new headset). I get the following error in bluetoothctl in which it appears to try connecting three times in rapid succession and then give up:
  Agent registered [bluetooth]# devices Device E3:28:E9:24:30:BA MPOW BH408 Device 20:19:09:37:F6:D9 U8I [bluetooth]# connect E3:28:E9:24:30:BA Attempting to connect to E3:28:E9:24:30:BA [CHG] Device E3:28:E9:24:30:BA Connected: yes Failed to connect: org.bluez.Error.Failed br-connection-canceled [CHG] Device E3:28:E9:24:30:BA Connected: no [CHG] Device E3:28:E9:24:30:BA Connected: yes [CHG] Device E3:28:E9:24:30:BA Connected: no [CHG] Device E3:28:E9:24:30:BA Connected: yes [CHG] Device E3:28:E9:24:30:BA Connected: no [bluetooth]# quit 
 What's weird is that the other device listed in bluetoothctl (my backup headset) connects without an issue (just bad sound as per the usual with this model), so it appears to be related to the particular combination of the version of Bluez and the MPOW BH408. It works under the slightly older version of Bluez currently used by Fedora 35. Any idea of how I can diagnose this? Not really a big deal as my new headset arrives Monday and I can put up with poor sound quality using my backup headset for a couple days.

I have tried countless times to resolve "bootctl --path=/boot, install exit with code [256]: b'File system "/boot" is not a FAT EFI System Partition (ESP) file system.". I have partitioned and flagged my nvme drive either through this script (doesn't flag), fdisk, gdisk, and gparted without a resolution. I have partitioned /boot with all the filesystem formats but same error. I'm certain the auto partitioning scheme works perfectly well however boot and root auot partitioned sizes are to small for my 1tb preferences. Anything I maybe missing or doing wrong is greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I was normally browsing Firefox when at some point some tabs stopped working randomly. I thought nothing of it and just closed firefox but then it would not start again, just as any other graphical app I try to open (Brave, VS Code and others). The error that firefox is giving me is:
 XPCOMGlueLoad error: error for file /usr/lib/firefox/libmozgtk.so libicuuc.so.71: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Couldn't load XPCOM
 VS Code gives me this error:
 /opt/visual-studio-code/bin/../code: error while loading shared libraries: libicuuc.so.71: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
 So yeah, it looks like something screwed up the stuff needed for graphical interfaces, but I did nothing other than update my system (and I see no one else currently complaining about some similar breakage). What should I do?
 EDIT: updated my system after typing this post out, everything now works normally ¯_(ツ)_/¯

I selected cinnamon as the DE and it's working fine, but I would like to try out a couple different DEs, so I installed LightDM. After installing cutefish, LightDM should now offer a selection between cinnamon and cutefish, right? Well, the greeter asks for the password and then boots straight into cinnamon.
 I read all the wiki pages and I still can't get LightDM to offer the choice. I tried modifying the ~/.dmrc file and creating an ~/.xinitrc file, but they only work halfway. Some windows use cutefish, and others, like the taskbar and start menu use cinnamon. Can someone tell me what I'm missing here? Do I need to reinstall without a DE, install LightDM first, and then install any DEs/WMs?
 Here's a screenshot with the files I've made/modified, and the mixed DEs. Sorry for being a noob https://imgur.com/a/2q30lQc

 I noticed in journalctl too that it made an error on boot saying failed to connect to "missing vm".
 How to fix?
 Not sure what to do since the file is still there so don't know how to make it register again?

Arch
 Cinnamon with Xorg (i.e. not wayland)
 Nvidia GPU
 Steam/Proton To Launch Game
 Single Monitor
  
Using Proton 6.3.8, I can launch BfV and it works like normal (full screen). If I switch to Proton 7, the game launches fine but just stays minimised in the bottom panel, and whenever I click it, it opens for a split second and minimises again. I've tried running a /etc/env value of export SDL_VIDEO_MINIMIZE_ON_FOCUS_LOSS=0. I've also tried using that variable in the launcher options for the game. If I run the game in 6.3.8 and change it to boarderless full screen, and then run the game in proton 7 it works (although, for whatever reason my menu bar keeps popping up every so often). I don't understand what I actually need to check to try and work out what bit is causing the game to constantly minimise. Where to go from here?
