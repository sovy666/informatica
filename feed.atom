        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys!
 (In case you're not interested in reading all this, thing I'd understand, please consider reading my questions at the end)
 I didn't know exactly where to write this question, but here's the thing.
 I've created USB bootables in a lot of ways. I was more used to creating them through interface programs. The fact is, I always used to have some kind of problem when creating them by console.
 Months ago I discovered the Arch wiki, it's been such a blessing to me. I'm learning a lot of topics and thanks to it I find myself improving on Linux.
 But here comes what happened. The other day I was looking how to create a bootable disk on the wiki. After reading on a lot of websites, I got to this line.
 "Make sure that it is not mounted."
 That simple sentence made my mind explode. All these years having issues trying to create a bootable through the console. I've formatted a drive multiple times just to make sure I understood. So I unmount the file system, and then I use some of the commands.
 Conclusion: My problems creating a bootable disk are gone.
 But I'm a curious person, and I always like to understand everything, so... Here I go!
 Questions
  
Why do we need to unmount the file system in order to write the iso to the drive?
 
Why does the process usually fail when the file system is mounted?
 
What is happening exactly when I do something like "cat arch.iso > /dev/sdx"?
 
And maybe this is a weird question, but why exactly does that work and not "cat arch.iso > /dev/sdx1" is it because the .iso file itself is like doing disk1(iso) > disk2(drive)?
 
 I'm still pretty newbie related some Linux things.
 I appreciate your patience just for the fact of reading all this. I look forward to see if I can understand whatever you explain! Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many arch users install both a kernel package of their choice and an additional kernel as a sort of "backup". This does not provide as much robustness as it could, largely due to what seems like an easily fixable design issue with pacman/dkms/mkinitcpio.
 For example, I have both the linux and linux-lts packages installed, and by default mkinitcpio creates both an autodetect and a fallback initramfs for both kernels, resulting in a total of 4 different images. One would expect that having 4 different initramfs to choose from would provide some robustness against boot issues.
 But it turns out that if you do a full pacman system update, it can apparently remove all the old vmlinuz and initramfs images from /boot/ before generating new ones. This seems to be related to dkms, as the /boot/ images are no longer present after the '70-dkms-install.hook' is invoked, but are only recreated by mkinitcpio after dkms is done (which depending on the number of dkms modules * number of kernels may take a while, e.g. a minute or so). So if your computer crashes during that vulnerable interval between the deletion of all the old /boot/ images at the same time and the generation of the new ones, you will end up with nothing to boot from.
 This issue seems entirely preventable by simply making sure that the /boot/ files are replaced sequentially, i.e. if pacman is called to update two or more kernels at the same time, do not let anything erase the /boot/ files related to two or more kernels simultaneously, but do it one after the other; do not touch any /boot/ files related to the second kernel while the first kernel is getting updated, and only begin updating the images related to the second kernel after the initramfs and vmlinuz images have already been generated for the first.

I assumed this has to be something like any other distro "Here's the documentation, go ahead, this should work just fine!" - well it's not of course. This is why I understand now that Arch Linux is not the distro for the daily Ubuntu Desktop user and Linux beginner in general, which does not mean that people shouldn't take a look of course!

Then SteamOS updated and suddenly nothing was working. When i type sudo easytether-usb or bluetooth into the Konsole, it tells me that command doesn't exist.

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQgyW10xD8s 
 Following the tutorial, he installs grub, efibootmgr, os-prober, dosfstools, and mtools. A new directory is created under the /boot directory called EFI. From root, he then runs: 
 grub -install --target=x86_64-efi --bootloader-id=grub_uefi --recheck 
 to allow grub installer to check for the EFI directory. This executes without errors for him. When I run it, I cannot get the installer to recognize the newly created EFI directory. The hint produced stated that systemd is referencing an old fstab and that I need to restart the daemon, but I can't as, while being chroot'd, the command is ignored. 
 My fstab has a dev/sda3 partition (my root) with an ext4 file system mounted to root '/'. dev/sda2 is a swap partition, and lastly, the dev/sda1 is a FAT32 partition that's mounted to the /boot directory. 
 I appreciate any guidance offered. I have checked the Wiki, but I can't find anything with my particular error. Please forgive a lowly Ubuntu user. 
 TIA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, since about two months, resuming from hibernation after running systemctl hibernate does not work and the monitor shows no video output.
 Setup: I configured hibernation into a swap file and kernel parameters according to this wiki page, and had everything working for the past ~5 years. I'm not aware of any recent changes that might be related.
 Error Description: Going into hibernation works without issues. After waking up I get into grub and select the entry for launching Arch Linux. Then I get a blinking cursor for some time, after which I would usually get back to my desktop, but since recently I'm only getting a black screen with the monitor telling me "No Signal" after a while.
 What I tried so far:
  
Using an older kernel version
 Using LTS kernel
 Trying to (blindly) open a terminal or switch to a different TTY and run poweroff to see whether the error is only related to video output. But since the PC didn't turn off and it doesn't show as active network device in my router I assume that the resume is failing.
 Removing all modules from early KMS as suggested by the troubleshooting section of the wiki page linked above
  
My main issue right now is that I can't find any information on how to debug the problem. If anyone has any suggestions or some information is missing please let me know.

 reboot, have the zfs disk plugged in
 shows importable pools - sudo zpool import
 
import it - sudo zpool import Pool-01
 if it was not exported before unplugging from the original machine then add -f flag
 
the import command will mount it in the root by its name, with datasets under it 
 
when you are done with whatever - sudo zpool export Pool-01
 
 If you need to access snapshots, you find them in a hidden .zfs directory inside datasets.
 Show hidden files wont help, nor ls -al but you can cd in to it cd /Pool-01/Dataset-01/.zfs or paste the full path in to your file explorer.
  
/background for this
 I am setting up homeserver for selfhosted stuff. Truenas scale in a VM is going to be serving as a NAS. It is centered around zfs, and I wanted to test that I can just unplug the disk out, put it elsewhere and access data. Would go for open media vault if it felt like cumbersome process.
 The above process took me surprisingly long, as I spent time dicking with repos and switching kernels and reading whatnot... 
 When all that is needed is the zfs dksm modul and then import the disk. Somehow I went in with the impression I am about to do a rocket surgery.

 first time posting here, so I hope I can ask my question clear enough.
 I just performed a very basic installation of arch with stock xMonad and qtile. The main thing that I couldn't quite figure out just yet, is how to lock my laptop (slock) whenever it suspends and/or the lid is closed, since that doesn't seem to be handled by the window manager, but rather systemd. If there are any articles on this or you have encountered this before, I'd be super thankful if you could give me a hand! Thanks in advance :)

 Works:
  
Kate
 Notepadqq
 L3afpad
 Pluma
 Firefox
 luakit
  
Does not work:
  
Mousepad
 Xed
 Gedit
 Geany
 Gnome text editor
 Thunar
 Pcmanfm-gtk3
  
I did double-check that primary paste is enabled using dconf-editor and I can confirm that toggling it does affect L3afpad and Pluma however it has no effect on Mousepad.
 Is this a Sway/wayland issue? GTK issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the ArchWiki on Unified Kernel Image there are two examples of .preset files for mkinitcpio. The second has configuration for the linux kernel image and a fallback image for linux-lts in the same linux.preset file. 
 While this works, how does mkinitcpio manage when there is a new version of the linux-lts kernel? There is no linux-lts.preset file in this case and I assume mkinitcpio only runs to update linux-lts (mkinitcpio -p linux-lts). Or does it run mkinitcpio -P with every kernel update (seems a litte overkill to me)? Or does it look at the contents of each .preset file? 
 Edit: typo in the title: must be mkinitcpio.

While still seeing some reported use today, unfortunately the same cannot be said for the quality of the VMEbus Linux support. After the VME subsystem was promoted out of staging a decade ago, the VME hardware drivers failed to ever leave staging and the code has fallen into disrepair and no maintenance now for the past half-decade. So the VME subsystem support is preparing to depart back to the land of the kernel's staging area...]]></summary>

 I fixed some options in /etc/default/grub and regenerate GRUB Configuration file.
 sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg 
 Windows disappeared from the GRUB options. How to get it back?
 I can boot Windows by manually open BIOS and choose Windows though. 
 [Edit]: Solved by mounting the the windows partition to /boot/efi and generate GRUB Configuration file again (it will spot Windows). Then unmount it, reboot and you are done. Thank Gvinfinity a lot for this.

 An example is dkms, which download the git source for the specific release tag. What I would've done before is download from github.com/dell/dkms/archive/v$pkgver.tar.gz (and save to $pkgname-$pkgver.tar.gz, as the Wiki recommends).
 But why is that? Why use git instead of a zipped source?

 I followed these instructions but when I boot and I'm prompted for a passphrase I try tapping the key and it sits thinking for a minute then returns;
 "no key available for this passphrase"
 What am I missing?
 All I did was enroll it, which said it used slot 1 and then added the volume to crypttab like the page said..
 I must be missing something.

 I was thinking that maybe I could dump the archiso into a partition on my harddrive and basically setup an "immutable" recovery partition that I can always boot into if I mess up my primary installation, arch-chroot from there and fix things.
 Does this make sense? If not, why and what do you suggest instead? If it does, are there any nice guides I can follow or will I have to wing it and potentially write my own guide (I'll share it here if I do)

 Infos (if you need more just ask):
 - I'm using pipewire-pulse (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PipeWire).
