        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just got out from trying to fix my arch install for hours after a gnome update, maybe someone else had the same problems.
 Been using Arch in HyperV Enhanced session mode with the same config for years with no problem, but among the last updates of gnome it just broke. The xrdp login shows like always, but after login the HyperV window says the connection dropped.
 Gnome was configured to start in .xinitrc in X11 mode. Xrdp sesman log just says the window manager exited with code 255 and signal 5, and that it exited quickly immediately.
 Tried fresh install in new VM with default xrdp and xorgxrdp. Config changed to use vsock and to not use encryption in rdp. Issue persists. Changed from gnome to xfce4 and everything works without issue
 Decided to stick with xfce4 after that, but thought maybe someone could shed some light on it. Or just to prevent someone else to waste time fixing their install

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tired of carrying around a bulky wallet filled with credit, debit, and loyalty cards? Then switch to mobile payments and a digital wallet. While you have a growing number of options here, Google Pay, Samsung Pay, and Apple Pay are three of the top choices available. They’re similar services, but each offers very distinct features. All three let you pay for purchases online and in-store (where available).
    
To figure out which is best for your needs, see how each option fares in terms of features, ease of use, and availability.
    
By itself, Apple Pay is a contactless mobile payment solution. When combined with Apple Wallet and Apple Cash, it matches the digital wallet feature set provided by Google Pay and Samsung Pay. However, we refer to Apple Pay as a digital wallet here to avoid confusion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For some reason the previews stopped in the Dolphin browser, however I found that it is working in the home directory but not on the other directories I couldn't find a fix for that.
 And while I was looking for a fix I found in filelight that /var/tmp/pamac-build-yamo/electron9 is taking 8.9 Gb So what is this and can I remove it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not on Linux for a long time, but I like it a lot. I'm currently using Linux Mint and even tho I like it I think it's just too user-friendly. I like challenges and learning and on Linux Mint there is nothing really to learn. And that's why I'm considering switching to Arch, I think it will give me a better understanding of Linux and hopefully teach me something. You know, it's a little different when you just flash Linux Mint into your PC, and when you have to build the whole operating system from scratch, even with the instruction. But I know Arch is not easy, especially for someone who is not on Linux for a long time. I will learn a bit first, try to install it on my other PC which is basically for testing things and then after some time of learning switch to Arch entirely. But still I would love to hear from more advanced and experienced users some tips or general advice. Even the stupidest shit might be useful for me. So that's basically what I'm asking for, general advice, maybe some not that obvious information about how things work on Arch, no noes, things that would make the switch easier, things that you wish you would know before you have switched to Arch etc.
 Thanks in advance for every reply :)

Unfortunately, there are a number of people who find modern smartphones either too confusing or too difficult to use. Elderly people are prone to being left behind as they find it hard to adapt to rapidly changing technology. Similarly, visually-impaired folks may have difficulty operating a device that relies on hand-eye coordination.
    
Fortunately, there are ways to combat these problems.
    
Some may find that specially-designed smartphones are the way to go. Alternatively, if you already have a phone, you can tweak the appearance of your Android phone with apps called launchers. Launchers can change the entire look and feel of your Android device, making them easier to use. The following Android launchers are designed with seniors and the visually-impaired in mind.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following this post about whether the linux-zen kernel is still viable for gaming I'd like to do some benchmark. I want to compare Arch's default kernel, linux-zen, linux-xanmod and linux-tkg.
 I'm asking myself which game's I should benchmark for a good overview, so I'm asking you. What game's should I benchmark?
 I guess I'm only going to benchmark three to five games and they should have an in-game benchmark to have consistent results. For now I settled with the following, but let me know if you want to see any other game.
 I choose those games because they're quite popular and I own all of them.
  
Red Dead Redemption 2
 Cyberpunk 2077
 Watch Dogs: Legion
 GTA 5
 Assassin's Creed: Odyssey
 Shadow of the Tomb Raider
 Far Cry 5
  
EDIT: I'll definitely add CS:GO and Civilization 6, because both games are especially heavy on the CPU. In terms of the other games I suggested I guess I'll go with GTA 5 because it's still pretty popular, as well as Cyberpunk 2077 because it's also popular and Shadow of the Tomb Raider because it is or was a well-established game for benchmarks.
 So the selection for now looks like this:
  
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
 Civilization VI
 Grand Theft Auto 5
 Cyberpunk 2077
 Shadow of the Tomb Raider

Se le stesse pagine vengono visitate da indirizzi IP europei il totale scende a poco più di 1.800 casi.Alla base del problema vi è l'utilizzo di componenti traccianti che monitorano l'attività dei visitatori, compongono profili individuali, registrano le interazioni con la pagina e mantengono un identificativo persistente in modo da individuare lo stesso utente durante le successive sessioni.Molti dei tracker in questione utilizzano script che monitorano le sequenze di tasti premute all'interno dei moduli e salvano il contenuto.]]></summary>

 I have a laptop, Legion 5 Pro (AMD). It has AMDGPU + NVIDIA.
 Currently after loading screen showed up, the screen on my laptop go blank. But external monitor over HDMI is working fine.
 When using NVIDIA, both laptop screen and external monitor are working. So, something went wrong somewhere and I don't know what. 
 I have been using NVIDIA GPU on my laptop, so I'm not sure since when this has been happening.
 My issue sounds like this one.

 Tested with:
  
linux 5.17.7.arch1-2
 linux-lts 5.15.40-1
 
 Would be great if someone can help me. Currently I am not using a Xorg config for display.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[È stata forse la prima infezione globale da ransomware della storia. Cinque anni fa, a maggio del 2017, cominciava il viaggio di una minaccia nota come WannaCry tra i sistemi informatici di mezzo mondo. Il malware in questione sfruttava una vulnerabilità scoperta nell'implementazione del protocollo SMB in Windows.Acronimo di Server Message Block, SMB è un protocollo comunemente utilizzato per condividere file, stampanti, porte seriali e comunicazioni di varia natura tra diversi nodi di una rete.Facendo leva sulla mancata applicazione della patch MS17-010, che nel frattempo Microsoft aveva rilasciato, WannaCry si diffondeva all'interno della rete locale andando alla ricerca di tutti i sistemi vulnerabili.Dal momento che nel 2017, come oggi, sono pochi i sistemi direttamente esposti sulla rete Internet (quindi senza protezione firewall/NAT), l'infezione aveva generalmente inizio con un doppio clic su un allegato malevolo ricevuto via email.Per dare un'idea dei danni causati 5 anni fa da WannaCry, basti pensare che il ransomware è riuscito a crittografare con una chiave tenuta segreta oltre 230.000 computer in 150 Paesi.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While at one point Apple devices were considered safe from vulnerabilities, one large reason they were considered “safe” is that hackers weren’t targeting them as much, as they weren’t as popular. Now that they’re more popular, they’re more vulnerable. Additionally, researchers have discovered that iPhones aren’t even safe when turned off. The chip that controls Bluetooth leaves iPhones vulnerable to malware even when powered down.

Research Shows iPhone Vulnerability
    
You were likely happy to find that an iOS 15 change allowed you to use the Find My feature even when your phone is powered down. But when you stop to think about it, how can your phone be discovered when it’s turned off? The answer is that it’s not really shut completely off, so it’s still vulnerable.

For context, I have used a great many distros, many of them debian based (ubuntu, mint, lubuntu), over the years. I got into Linux in the mid 2000s, after a computer failure left me without a hard drive and a friend showed me how to boot from a usb and I taught myself to install to USB, back when 4gb was an expensive(ish) buy for a usb drive. 
 I loved linux immediately, and although Ubuntu was my first distro, I hopped a lot, usually just multi booting, always with Windows too, just in case. I eventually became more comfortable with linux to the point I started running my own servers for small webhosting projects. I also found I liked using a linux desktop for php development as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been scratching my head for this problem and can’t seem to figure it out. I have reinstalled arch multiple time but it always come back. 
 Issue:
 Issue can be easily spot in firefox while scrolling specially arch wiki (white background and lots of texts). 
 Glitches appears as horizontal bar and in that bar almost all fonts gets little bigger kind of thing so it feels like there is some kind of glass cylinder making some font little different and then other.
 In a full screen it is easy to spot as well.
 Troubleshoot:
  
 So far i have tried installation arch multiple time but I think all the packages I install are same except windows manager, first it was xmonad and now its qtile
  I have tried manjaro (kde, sway, xfce) all works fine.
  I have 20-intel.conf for TearFree and TrippleBuffer but no help. 
  Already uninstalled picom compositor.
  From arch wiki also disabled vsync as well but no help.
  
Hardware:
  
 i5-8250u
  UHD-620
  
Driver that i have right now:
  
 mesa
  xf86-video-intel
  vulkan-intel
  
Any help would be really good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Smartphones, for the most part, have opened up technology to seniors and the older generation — their intuitive and large touch-screens proving much friendlier to use than old mobile phones with buttons (or circle-dial phones).
    
When looking at the best smartphone for seniors, we took various criteria into account like screen brightness and size, special accessibility features, and modernity. Do your grandma and grandpa think an Android is the metal trashcan from “Lost In Space”? It’s time to take them under the arm and guide them into the modern age. The phones listed below should be enough to convince them that smartphone technology isn’t all that scary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ci sono persone che preferiscono utilizzare i programmi portable perché “sporcano” meno il sistema operativo, rispetto a un normale programma installato, inoltre sono più facili da eliminare perché, se non ci interessano più, basta cancellarli. Uno dei pochi svantaggi è che non vengono direttamente registrati tra i programmi utilizzabili per aprire un determinato tipo di file. In genere, il programma portable può avere le sue opzioni per poterlo fare, oppure possiamo noi cambiare manualmente questo tipo di associazione, ma grazie a Portable Registrator possiamo rendere più semplice questa associazione e registrare le applicazioni portable tra quelle utilizzabili.

 I know this is not easily measurable and it perhaps depends on the machine used but anyway...
 Has anybody else also experienced that Firefox feels a bit faster and snappier (lower latency) in the current GNOME 42/Wayland than in SwayWM? Frankly, I expected the opposite to be true because Sway feels so vanilla. So I expected less layers => faster perfomance...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The wiki says,
  
The default configuration files are ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf and ~/.gnupg/dirmngr.conf. 
 ... 
 You will find skeleton files in /usr/share/doc/gnupg/. These files are copied to ~/.gnupg the first time gpg is run if they do not exist there. Other examples are found in #See also.
  
But this is wrong. I've run gpg and I don't have those files. Neither do I have the skeleton in the /usr/ directory. I do have the file /usr/share/doc/gnupg/examples/gpgconf.conf, but ironically this file clearly states at the beginning that,
  
# This is a legacy mechanism. The modern way is to use global 
 # configuration files like /etc/gnupg/gpg.conf which are more 
 # flexible and better integrated into the configuration system.
  
But, there is no /etc/gnupg/gpg.conf.
 #########################################################################
 The wiki also says that we should add public key servers to the file ~/.gnupg/dirmngr.conf. But at openpgp.org it says we should add the key servers to the file gpg.conf.
 #########################################################################
 There are a lot of contradictory statements here.
 How do we set this program up?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there, I successfully run Arch-Linux with KDE for a couple of years without any bigger problems. However, today I upgraded my system and since then KDE plasma (X11) is full of bugs. Tray icons of non-plasma programs didn't show up, plasma-nm (even if it wasn't updated) couldn't connect to any openvpn connection (it worked with openvpn XY.conf via the terminal), opening a file from dolphin took ages and I couldn't switch my keyboard layouts anymore from the panel nor my global shortcuts.
 I did checked the logs, but I couldn't find any errors, I checked the arch bug tracker of all kde programs I've upgraded, but I couldn't find any bug. I reset my panels and set them up again, but it didn't change anything for me, I tired a wayland session, which did allow me to change the keyboard layout again, but didn't solve any of the other problems.
 However, as I had to get back to work, I downgraded all my packages via the arch archive to 2022-05-12 (the time I ran the last time updates) and since then everything runs smooth.
 Here the list of packages I've upgraded today (and now downgraded): https://pastebin.com/GZq8AF2n
 Do you guys experience the same problems? Do you have an idea which programs cause the bugs, so we/I can make a helpful bug report?
 Cheers and thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having dash cam footage during an accident or capturing what happens to your car in a parking lot can save you a lot of time and headaches. Picking the perfect dash cam, though, isn’t always easy. The 70mai Dash Cam M500 is designed to make it easier to record your travels and monitor your car in parking lots. I recently had the opportunity take this dash cam for a test drive to test out its features.
    
This is a sponsored article and was made possible by 70mai. The actual contents and opinions are the sole views of the author who maintains editorial independence even when a post is sponsored.
    
Overview of Features
    
The 70mai Dash Cam M500 packs a lot of features into a small package. Unlike most dash cams that require a microSD card, this one has 64 GB of eMMC built-in storage. Not only does this type of storage usually last longer than your average SD card, but you don’t have to worry about a card being damaged and losing your footage.

Il TGP dovrebbe attestarsi sui 450W.Con la versione 'Ti', il chip grafico potrebbe essere quindi ancora più potente e spingersi fino a un massimo di 18.432 shader.]]></summary>

 ThinkPad T460 Intel Core i5 6300 KDE on X11 Kernel: 5.15 
 I've got the drivers installed (libva-intel-driver), vainfo says it's fine and I got it to work. I read the Arch wiki in all details.In Firefox with rdd sandbox deactivated it works well... until it didn't while the video played. I don't know why. Right now after reboot it works.
 Playback with mpv doesn't work but it worked before. mpv.conf is set to activate vaapi but it worked without hassle before I set it there. Playing back with Haruna, which uses mpv, doesn't use vaapi until I open settings and navigate to playback where I set it to vaapi, then it uses surprinsingly the hardware decode units. Maybe less than it should but I'm not sure about that.
 What the hell is going on? I get the Firefox thing, which will be hopefully resolved in the near future. But everything in all it works until it doesn't. It's so unstable.I could try it once more in Wayland but back then it didn't.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am unsure if this belongs to /zfs or /archlinux, but lets give it a shot here.
 I updated my Arch on ZFS. On reboot, Grub complains that the vmlinuz image cant be found.
 After a reboot from an USB with my Arch stick (with zfs), I was able to import and mount the zpool. All my files in /home is there, and the rest of the Linux files too. But /boot is empty except for the grub files. No initrd or vmlinuz files to be found.
 # zpool list
 zroot 446G 51G 392G ...
 # mkdir /zzz
 There is two zfs filesystems, the root fs and a home fs. Both are shown when I do an zfs list
 zroot
 zroot/rootfs /zzz
 zroot/rootfs/home /zzz/home
 The disk also have an EFI partition, but it is not used for kernel images. The only files there are related to EFI itself.
 # zfs get mountpoint
 List of the root filesystem and all snapshots. Looks good including the snapshot I made before the (failed) update today.
 zfs mount -a
 # arch-chroot /zzz
 ls -l /boot
 NADA
 What now? Do I need to redo the (quite complex) linux+zfs installation, or is there some way to recover.
