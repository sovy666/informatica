Windows allows you to sort files by size in multiple ways, however it does not provide a definitive way to sort folders by size. To overcome this shortcoming, users can choose from multiple third-party apps. We cover three of them right after we show you how to sort files by size and how to view folder size.

Il problema sorge quando dovremo sbarazzarci del secondo sistema, se non dovesse piacerci, o risultare non compatibile con il nostro computer e le nostre esigenze. Togliere il boot manager e le partizioni aggiuntive, se qualcosa dovesse andare storto durante queste operazioni, potrebbe comportare dei problemi al sistema operativo presente inizialmente da non poter più avviarlo. Meglio allora virtualizzare.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I have been using manjaro for the las couple of months and honestly my experience hasn't been great. I know that manjaro is not really arch and it delays packages for 1-2 weeks which can cause stability issues, but it is still arch based and has a lot of similarities with it. 
 Since I have been using it, my wifi has stopped working completely on two occasions, making me do a full reboot in order to get it working. Also the ui seems very buggy, like sometimes I increase the volume and the indicator on kde doesnt move and stuff like that. On one occasion, my monitor started glitching out all of a sudden and I needed to reboot to get it working again.
 I was thinking of switching to endeavourOs but I dont know if I will have a different experience. How has your experience been? Is it normal for things to break on this distribution? How stable is this when compared to something like fedora?

Fortunately, you don’t need to discard the entire photo as you can easily remove objects or people from it on both mobile and PC. You can use native tools (if available), third-party apps, and web-based tools to remove extra objects, defects, text, and stickers from images. Let’s see how to do that on various platforms.

Adjust the TV's built-in geometry settings
 Use an xrandr option such as --set underscan on
 Use --transform to shrink the screen to fit on the monitor
 Restrict the frame buffer using --fb
  
This TV is very old, and it does not have any geometry settings. Any fix would have to be handled by my computer, not by the TV.
 I'm using an HDMI to RCA-composite to coaxial composite adapter set. Under xrandr --props, there is no underscan/overscan option. Here is the relevant section:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's assume I have a LUKS2 root that has two used slots: a passphrase and a key file.
 I want to unlock the device at boot with TPM2, and ideally I want the 0+4+7 registry combination. This means I have to wipe and re-enroll the (third) TPM2 slots from the LUKS2 device every time I do a kernel update. 
 Whenever such an update is made, I also have an ALPM hook that creates an efistub and signs it for secure boot without my interaction (the signing key is stored in a protected folder). 
 How can I achieve a similar non-interactive re-enrollment of my TPM2 key slot? ideally it doesn't prompt me with:
  🔐 Please enter current passphrase for disk /dev/nvme0n1p2: ****** New TPM2 token enrolled as key slot 2. 
 but I can the keyfile used for the second slot so it can do it autonomously

If wanting to run Coreboot on a system today it basically means running a Google Chromebook, using an outdated server motherboard or old Lenovo ThinkPad that has seen a Coreboot port, or out of reach to most individuals are various server motherboards that are reference platforms or board designs from hyperscalers. But over the past several months the folks at the 3mdeb consulting firm have carried out a terrific feat: porting their "Dasharo" downstream of Coreboot to a modern and readily available Intel desktop motherboard. I've been trying this out and it has worked out surprisingly well. Here are my experiences and benchmarks of Coreboot/Dasharo on this Intel Alder Lake motherboard.]]></summary>

I've read a lot and googled a lot but there are so many ways of doing things and I only understand very superficially what's going on with my system. Hosts? Resolved? Nscd? Dhcpcd? Tun0? I understand most of it but don't know how to analyze what I actually have going on and how to get to where I want to be.
 I realize this is not super common but if you feel like you have a good grasp on dns resolution and vpn tunnels I will pay you some small amount for an hour of your time explaining over Google meets, discord, telegram or whatever how I should go about diagnosing my setup and understanding what it currently does. Hope this isn't against the rules of the sub. Again, I am not looking for tech support so much as a tutor. Thank you in advance.

Black Lotus cita alcuni modelli di router a marchio Cisco, Netgear, Asus e DrayTek.ZuoRAT, una volta infettato il router, è in grado di stabilire l'elenco dei dispositivi connessi raccogliendo contemporaneamente le richieste di risoluzione DNS e i pacchetti dati inviati e ricevuti.Alle spiccate abilità tecniche, ZuoRAT abbina funzionalità che gli permettono di rimanere nascosto e usare un 'basso profilo' per scavalcare eventuali tentativi di rilevamento.L'utilizzo di tecniche DNS e HTTP hijacking che hanno come obiettivo quello di modificare il traffico dati servendo ai dispositivi collegati contenuti che non sono quelli legittimi, è evidente spia dell'approccio avanzato che ZuoRAT utilizza.Tanto che i ricercatori ipotizzano la realizzazione del malware a seguito di un ingente investimento da parte di qualche governo.Black Lotus ha aggiunto che l'infrastruttura command and control usata da ZuoRAT appare volutamente complessa con il preciso intento di celare ciò che sta accadendo.]]></summary>

Quest'ultimo viene inoltre dimensionato in maniera tale che il gate sia posizionato al di sotto del canale, non soltanto nelle parti superiore e laterali.

Il fatto è che lo spazio a disposizione nella memoria interna del telefono è limitato e spesso, se si fosse soliti memorizzare tante foto, anche la micro SD - per quei dispositivi che integrano lo slot per accoglierla - tende a riempirsi velocemente.Ecco quindi che si guarda ai servizi di storage cloud come soluzione per creare una copia di backup dei dati e recuperare spazio prezioso sui propri dispositivi.Google Foto è una delle soluzioni più famose per creare backup della galleria su smartphone e altre dispositivi: da giugno 2021, però, tutti i file caricati su Google Foto (comprese le foto in 'alta qualità') occupano spazio ed erodono il quantitativo di giga a disposizione sui server dell'azienda statunitense.Amazon Photos è diverso e a tutti gli abbonati al servizio Prime (nel 2020 erano circa 150 milioni in tutto il mondo) assicura memorizzazione illimitata delle immagini: non importa che peso abbiano, su Amazon Photos è possibile caricare ogni genere di foto, anche in formato RAW.]]></summary>

The latest hit is from the Federal Communications Commission. The FCC commissioner sent a letter to Apple and Google, asking them to ban TikTok, believing the social app is a “national security threat.”

The FCC TikTok Complaint
    
TikTok originates from a Chinese company, ByteDance. The Beijing company has admitted to keeping information that belongs to users in the U.S.
    
FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr posted a letter to Twitter that he had sent to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Carr complained in the letter about “an alarming new report [that] sheds fresh light on the serious national security threats posed by TikTok.”

Le immagini possono essere caricate ad alta risoluzione e addirittura in formato RAW: per gli abbonati ad Amazon Prime non ci sono limiti. Soltanto nel caso del backup dei video e di altri contenuti che non siano foto, Amazon impone un limite massimo di 5 GB.Inutile dire, quindi, quanto Amazon Photos sia un servizio apprezzato e popolare tra gli utenti.L'importante è accertarsi di aver aggiornato l'app Android di Amazon Photos: gli sviluppatori di Checkmarx hanno infatti scoperto a suo tempo una vulnerabilità che è stata nel frattempo risolta dei tecnici della società guidata da Jeff Bezos.App malevole eventualmente presenti sullo stesso dispositivo Android avrebbero potuto sottrarre il token autorizzativo dall'app Amazon Photos e utilizzarlo per accedere, con l''identità' dell'utente, all'intero archivio fotografico e agli altri servizi Amazon.Nelle mani dei criminali informatici, il token Amazon avrebbe potuto essere sfruttato per diffondere ransomware crittografando tutti i dati dell'utente memorizzati sul cloud per poi richiedere un riscatto in denaro.L'attività dei ransomware è a torto generalmente collegata con attacchi che si concretizzano sui singoli sistemi locali mentre la tendenza è quella di aggredire con sempre maggior frequenza i servizi di storage sul cloud, contenitori di dati personali di grande valore..]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Si chiama querystring la parte di un URL (ad esempio l'indirizzo che compare nella barra del browser) che contiene dati da passare in ingresso, ad esempio, a un'applicazione Web o a un programma. Non è sempre presente e quando lo è segue il simbolo del punto interrogativo nell'URL.Abbiamo visto in un altro articolo cos'è un URL, come funziona e quali sono i potenziali pericoli.I parametri contenuti nella querystring sono spesso necessari per il corretto funzionamento delle applicazioni Web perché, come accennato in precedenza, trasferiscono informazioni utili. Si pensi alla struttura dei collegamenti ipertestuali (link) presenti in una pagina Web: i dati della querystring possono ad esempio indicare il nome o l'identificativo del contenuto che l'utente vuole visualizzare.Come ricorda Mozilla, però, alcuni parametri trasmessi attraverso la querystring non sono indispensabili per il funzionamento delle applicazioni Web e vengono utilizzati per inviare su server remoti informazioni sull'utente che visita una certa pagina.Così, con il rilascio di Firefox 102, Mozilla ha deciso di inserire nel suo browser un meccanismo che provvede a rimuovere dalla querystring quei parametri che vengono tipicamente utilizzati con finalità di marketing da aziende come Meta-Facebook, Marketo, Olytics, HubSpot, Drip, Vero ed altre ancora.Nelle impostazioni sulla privacy di Firefox, il browser Mozilla si riferisce alla nuova funzione parlando di blocco dei traccianti dei social media.Il nuovo strumento non risulta attivo per impostazione predefinita nelle finestre di navigazione in incognito ('finestra anonima').]]></summary>

I'm not going to lie, I got scared. But nobody knew much about it, so I'm here to help the poor people who have gotten stuck in the same situation ;3. So go to your BIOS settings, if touchpad settings is there click on the option other than the one that was selected (This is because the names of the settings were different for others, mine was p2s). IF YOU CANT SEE IT CLICK <CTRL+S> !!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I have my sleep set to deep (cat /sys/power/mem\_sleep returns s2idle [deep]) and my laptop wakes up, my trackpad no longer works correctly. The acceleration is incredibly high and the only touch gesture that works is a single tap to left click. I've tried restarting it with sudo modprobe -r psmouse and then sudo modprobe psmouse but it doesn't seem to do anything and I can't find anything else that might indicate a solution. So far, the only fix is to reboot my laptop which is a bit of a pain and defeats the purpose of sleep.
 Any help would be much appreciated.

You can use vDos to help you run old DOS software if you need to, although it isn’t a suitable option for gaming. Here’s how to use it.

So, in order to make my Arch install more secure, I'm thinking of doing a full disk encryption without doing a reinstallation. I'm thinking of doing it this way :
  
Unmount the /boot partition.
 Mount it under another name, create a boot directory in root partition.
 Copy all the content of older boot partition to the new directory
 Removing Fstab entry which was responsible for mounting old boot
 Modifying Grub config file to allow booting from an encrypted partition and surely regenerate grub config.
  
Is this correct ? Did I miss any part ? Please tell me in the comments, thanks in advance!

You can start them now with an Amazon Halo View Fitness Tracker. It’s an early Amazon Prime Day deal, saving you $35.
    
When fitness trackers first became the rage, it was enough just to have a device that counted your steps. But with the advancements in trackers and smartwatches, we demand more from our fitness trackers. Halo health metrics allow you to access your heart rate, activity points, sleep score, oxygen levels, and more.
    
Along with the Amazon Halo View Fitness Tracker, you’ll get 12 months of full access to the Halo membership that provides features, workouts, and programs. After one year, it auto-renews for $3.99/monthly plus tax. The Halo app will give you a movement assessment and personalized exercise program to improve your health. It will measure the quantity and quality of your sleep and allow you to experience daily meditations and recipes from WW and Whole Foods Market.

 Networking gets killed (complete service crash where the icon doesn't even work). Bluetooth gets killed (complete crash). The power manager gets killed (complete crash, wildly inaccurate battery readings).

I'm sick of this. I want it all gone.
 How do I mass purge LightDM, "dm-tool --lock", and anything else vaguely related to LightDM from my system?
 If it sat above or below LightDM in the Task Manager, I want it gone.
 If it sat next to LightDM in the Applications list, I want it gone.
 Anything that shared a folder next to LightDM I want utterly destroyed via the Death Star.
  
Once it's gone, what's something actually reliable and secure I can replace it with? (GTK only please)

 I want to install Arch on my laptop and use LUKS encryption like it's described here https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#LUKS_on_a_partition
 But as far as I understood, my passphrase will be asked before the system is loaded. And only after that I will see display manager and will be asked to enter user password.
 What I'm looking for is something like FileVault experience on Mac. There I have user login menu after some basic system is loaded and I need to enter my user password. The key is encrypted with my user password, so I need to enter the password only once.
 Is there any way to do something like that with LUKS and linux?
