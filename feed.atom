 Everything works ok right now but package updates is something that can be boring as I need to pay attention to paru output and update patched packages separately by applying patches manually. 
 So I am looking for a way to auto apply my patches on top of recent changes in PKGBUILD and ignoring them when checking for updates in AUR.

 Just about 20 minutes ago, when I was normally using my Arch, I noticed a laggy mouse movement, so I thought like: "Hmmm, maybe my picom is making trouble again".
 So I killed all the picom processes but that didn't helped, so I quit every other programs that were running in the background but that still wasn't enough, so I just opened gotop (system monitoring program) to check wtf is going on. CPU was on 0-3% so I was like: "Hmm, that's weird". But when I moved my mouse around, the CPU jumped to 20%, sometimes to 30% for all cores... So I booted into live Void Linux ISO to see if it's a problem with Arch/bspwm and it wasn't, the same thing was happening on Void Linux, then I changed my mouse to a wired one and... The issue was gone... 
 ​
 Anyone knows what is going on? Should I return my mouse? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had not used my laptop for 1 week, but when I used it past week, probably after an update, the wifi interface did not show up.
 Thinking it was an issue with 5.18 kernel update (I also had 5.15-lts), I booted into Ubuntu live usb (old version). Same issue happened. Not able to connect to internet via wifi.
 Since I had left the laptop (unfortunately on power) for 1 week, I thought something short circuited and the issue is now permanent. Although, I had read issues regarding 5.18, and someone was able to get it back, when then rebooted to Windows and back again to Arch. In my case, I had given up. Since I had a WiFI dongle, I had managed till today.
 However, today after an update (kernel), Wifi is back again without the dongle (even after multiple reboot). Not sure, how this can happen.
 Currently, I can see this log:
 Jul 10 kernel: ath10k_pci 0000:04:00.0 wlp4s0: renamed from wlan0
 Which I did not see when it failed.
 These are my internet devices:
 03:00.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL8111/8168/8411 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 15)
 04:00.0 Network controller: Qualcomm Atheros QCA6174 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter (rev 32)

 This is an issue I can reproduce consistently. This started happening yesterday, and it seems to only happen when playing DOOM Eternal.
 I tried to use artificial stress tests like mprime and stress to see if my CPU is stable, but after 13 hours of mprime and 4 hours of stress, there were no crashes whatsoever. I also tried running memtest and it gave me no errors as well.
 Any clue what might be wrong? I have almost 1000 hours in this game on this machine with 0 issues, but now I'm getting these crashes and I have no idea why.
 Thanks in advance.

 PS1='\e[1;32m[\u@\h\e[0m \W\e[1;32m]\$ \e[0m'
 When I set my PS1 to this, writing some long command or simply spamming a key causes the text to wrap around before actually getting to the end of ther terminal window, and overwriting the beginning of the same line instead of going to the next one. The terminal will look something like this:
 rrrrrrrrhostname ~]$ rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
 Can someone point out what's wrong with it? Thanks

 Don’t know if it’s here I can ask, if not I’ll put somewhere else. So I’m messing around with some WM, and kinda installed one by chadwm which use st as terminal. Everything go well except for st configuration. I started to configure with Xresources but to no avail and after reading a bit the doc it says that I must use a “config.h” file. There’s one inside chadwm folder but nothing changes and I still can’t figure it out where to put this file. Any advise?

 I plug in my USB flash drive, turn on the computer and mash F11 until I get boot menu. I sellect the USB.
 After that the menu pops up, I select Arch Linux install medium x64 UEFI.
 That goes away and in a split second I see these 4 lines:
 ::running early hook [udev] Starting version 251.2-1-arch ::running early hook [archiso_pxe_...] ::running hook [udev] 
 That's basically it, after that screen goes black and I can only restart my PC.
 ​
 My USB drive is flashed with the latest ISO via Etcher. First I thought that the flash went wrong, but when I plug the drive into some old laptop that I have, it boots right into installation.
 When it comes to BIOS settings, secure boot is disabled, only thing that's on is fast boot but I'm not sure if that would change anything.
 My specs are:
 11600k
 z590 Pro WIFI from MSI
 3080 FE
 ​
 If anyone has an idea what to do I would be very grateful, I've installed Arch on other systems several times without problems... 
 EDIT: I tried changing fast boot to disabled, did nothing. I also tried flashing ISO with Rufus both as ISO or DD image, also did nothing.

 Fast foward to 2018. I get a once in a lifetime chance to visit a foreign country with my dad. No way I'm bringing a $2500 laptop with me, so I bought one of the 2011 Lenovo no HDD specials on eBay, threw a SSD in there, and installed Pop!_OS. Sure as hell wasn't going to run Windows.

 How can I set my default audio device to "EasyEffects Sink" using WirePlumber, such that every audio output plays through EasyEffects before going to my sound card?
 Details
 A few days ago, an update swapped out pipewire-media-session for wireplumber, and now Firefox doesn't play nice with EasyEffects.
 For all other programs, the audio plays through the correct devices. However, Firefox skips out the EasyEffects steps and goes straight to my USB sound card.
 spotify -> EasyEffects Sink -> equalizer -> USB Sound Card firefox -> USB Sound Card 
 You can see my full patchbay here; https://imgur.com/a/6XlTLKl
 Using the Helvum patchbay, I can pipe the firefox audio output through EasyEffects Sink first, but it reverts back to going straight to my sound card after pausing any playing audio.

 However, it also states this:
  
A default scaling driver and governor are selected automatically 
  
Do I need to install those governors and drivers or are there some defaults in place that will handle basic CPU frequency scaling for now?

The files haven’t disappeared, though. You just have to dig in to your Android device’s settings to find them. In some cases, you may need to install a file manager to help you keep those downloaded files under control. Let’s take a look at some options.

 In the AUR there is a stickied comment with instructions on how to manually build mesa-git, because apparently it's necessary due to compatibility with llvm.
 Okay, it kind of defeats the whole purpose of using an AUR helper if I have to do this manually, but surely I'm not the only person using mesa-git, and thus surely someone smarter than me must've written a script or something to automate this process right?
 Right?
 Apparently not. Why not? Is no one using mesa-git? Is every user using mesa-git taking the time to manually download and build mesa-git on every upgrade?
 Loving the downvotes from asking a question. How are people supposed to learn?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, sorry sorry for the English, it's not my mother tongue, I'm just translating.
 ​
 I recently reinstalled my Arch and decided to give Btrfs a try. Since creating snapshots is so easy, I was wondering if I might have some mechanism to recover from a damaged system without any external bootable media?
 ​
 For work purposes, I dualboot Arch and Windows, use the Windows boot partition mounted at /boot, and use grub as the bootloader.
 ​
 Create the subvolumes:
 @ --> /
 @home --> /home
 @snapshots --> /.snapshots
 I saw some cool tools like snapper, pacman hooks and grub-btrfs to automatically create snapshots and add them as entries in grub.
 Everything works as expected when I try to boot a snapshot with the same kernel, but if there is an update I can't boot the snapshots with an old kernel, it gives me the following error messages:
 ​
 Failed to mount /boot
 Dependency failed for Local File Systems
 ​
 Someone who knows what may be wrong in my configuration... Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm using pipewire, and pipewire-pulse package. I got a 3.5mm mic so I can record videos for a talk. They gave me a TRSS pin too for the computer.
 I haven't messed around much with audio before so it's a bit confusing to me, I ran the alsa-info scripthttp://alsa-project.org/db/?f=2ee94be11eab9c9abcea641d6b74392c5db9ea98
 And this is the output of `amixer -c1`.
 https://gist.github.com/afro-coder/b112a9631555dd4d302eba481cc10cba
 I've added the following to modprodbe.d/hda.conf
 options snd-hda-intel power_save=0 power_save_controller=N model=dell-headset-multi 
 In my Volume control, I can see that there is an option for a headset microphone

 Output of `pactl list-sources`
 https://gist.github.com/afro-coder/9ed3a2788797e831164dbdebd10381ce
 I can't seem to figure out if it's actually picking up the audio from the microphone or from the internal microphone and even OBS studio doesn't seem to be able to use it, the background noise that I get in the microphone is too loud
 The internal microphone picks up sounds from quite far away I tested the 3.5 mm with android and it silences the surrounding noise, so I'm not sure what more to check. Any help or nudge would help, been trying to figure this out for days.
