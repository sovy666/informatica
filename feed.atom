 I couldn't find any good guide on how to setup XRDP on Arch Linux.
 Can someone provide a link or steps needed?
 So far I installed xrdp using this AUR package:
 https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/xrdp
 I'm clueless what to do next.
 Note: I like RDP than VNC because RDP is much faster than VNC, I do not need encryption since the machine will only be used locally.
 Thanks.

 When I try to install GRUB with grub-install I get: /usr/bin/grub-probe: error: cannot find a GRUB drive for /dev/sda1. Check your device.map. This full command output will be pasted at the end of this post. 
 Got same above error when grub-mkconfig.
 This is the head of my grub config.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes, touchpad is freezing randomly. It doesnt happen if i am using a mouse. I am using arch, btw. Its a new laptop, less than one month old. Initially i had trouble with brightness control. But changing to gnome from xfce solved the brightness issue. The touchpad has no buttons and has a fingerprint scanner on top right corner. Its a clickpad. I tried installing xf86-input-mtrack also. I tried setting cpu to performance mode. But i still experience the issues. 
 It also doesnt seem to stop when i disabled animations. I have installed fingerprint drivers and fingerprint is also working. Archwiki suggest to change desktop environments, i tried kde and budgie and both have the same issue.

In addition, 32 RGB LED lights on the top of the speaker support five light-switching modes. You’ll be entertained by the lights and your music while floating along in the pool. It can be both fun and beautiful.

 Yesterday I updated via pacman -Syu and now my sound (using pipewire, pipewire-pulse) started showing serious problems:
 - sound started popping and crackling - if I stop a sound source (youtube video or deadbeef song) it still repeats little sound bites though the program (browser or deadbeef) is already closed...
 - playing a song in deadbeef just repeats, hangs, pops, cracks ... it's a mess... 
 For lack of a better description I get a "robotic echo" of parts of the sound sample...
 The same happens if I go into Kde system settings > audio and use the test for left or right speakers... - the short sample sound is repeating little parts and never finishes
 Is there any remedy? Anyone else with theses problems...?
 systemctl --user status wireplumber
 gives me : Failed to set scheduler settings: operation not permitted 
 Thanks for any help.
 Cheers, p.

 I've made a Pastebin of the journal right after it happened here: https://pastebin.com/uEeQTRk9
 I just don't know enough about the inner workings of Plasma and X to know what issue is causing this. I also never had this before even when running Arch with Plasma. It started happening on this install, which is now 3 day old.
 I'm running arch, installed through archinstall script. BTRFS Setup, Ryzen 5 3600, Nvidia GTX1070ti. I'm running on Proprietary drivers, "normal" linux kernel, everything up to date and rebooted.
 Primary Screen is a 27" 1440p 165 Hz Monitor. Secondary is 27" 1440p 75Hz but Vertical and Left of the Primary Screen. I'm running Systemd Boot and only Xorg Session. Wayland has never been logged in. After reboots and such the Layout is correct.
 Both Screens are connected to my Main PC and a Laptop at the same time and i switch Inputs on both to switch between Work Laptop and Personal PC. It seems to only happen when i switch inputs, but not always.
 Doas anyone have any idea what i should look into to track this down? I'm pretty lost as this is a "standard" install that i have run many times before and never had issues with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Le unità a stato solido o SSD si basano sull'uso di memorie flash NAND non volatili. Come nel caso di un hard disk magnetomeccanico gli SSD possono memorizzare i dati che rimangono conservati anche dopo il completo spegnimento del dispositivo. Il principale vantaggio delle unità SSD è che non hanno parti in movimento e non fanno affidamento su di una testina per leggere e scrivere le informazioni.L'utilizzo di un'interfaccia veloce, come PCI Express, per il trasferimento dati consente performance impensabili con gli hard disk tradizionali.In un altro articolo abbiamo riassunto le principali differenze tra hard disk e SSD.La connessione PCI Express di quinta generazione può trasmettere fino a 4 GB/s di dati in parallelo per pin di dati. Ciò significa che le unità a stato solido di tipo M.2 che utilizzano una variante a 4 corsie dello standard saranno in grado di trasmettere fino a 16 GB/s di dati .]]></summary>

Ma non è possibile acquistare un prodotto che sia in grado di supportare i processori di entrambe le aziende? La risposta breve è: no, oggi non è possibile farlo.Prima ancora che tecnico il motivo è legale: sia Intel che AMD si coprono le spalle con apposite clausole che evitano la progettazione, la realizzazione e l'immissione sul mercato di schede madri con due socket e chipset diversi al fine di supportare l'utilizzo dei processori di entrambi i produttori.Va detto che arrivare oggi a una 'scheda madre universale' sarebbe inoltre piuttosto complesso dal punto di vista architetturale: bisognerebbe adattare il funzionamento di tutti i componenti a due sistemi Intel-AMD che gestiscono le tensioni in modi del tutto differenti.Anche la gestione della memoria RAM sarebbe notevolmente diversa nonostante possano essere utilizzati gli stessi slot.C'è poi l'aspetto più evidente: dal punto di vista fisico nessun socket di AMD e Intel è sovrapponibile.]]></summary>

 Using sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/Win/"2tb HDD" I get the error: 
  
mount: /mnt/Win/2tb HDD: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sda2, missing codepage or helper program, or other error.
 dmesg(1) may have more information after failed mount system call. 
  
using sudo ntfs-3g /dev/sda2 /mnt/Win/"2tb HDD" to mount I get: 
  
NTFS signature is missing.
 Failed to mount '/dev/sda2': Invalid argument
 The device '/dev/sda2' doesn't seem to have a valid NTFS.
 Maybe the wrong device is used? Or the whole disk instead of a
 partition (e.g. /dev/sda, not /dev/sda1)? Or the other way around? 
  
I tried running sudo ntfsfix /dev/sda2 but get: 
  
Mounting volume... NTFS signature is missing.
 FAILED
 Attempting to correct errors... NTFS signature is missing.
 FAILED
 Failed to startup volume: Invalid argument
 NTFS signature is missing.
 Trying the alternate boot sector
 Unrecoverable error
 Volume is corrupt. You should run chkdsk. 
  
I tried switching to windows, where the HDD seem perfectly fine, right clicked D: drive > properties > tools >check and windows did not find any errors. I also tried running Chkdsk /f /r /D: through an elevated command prompt but receive:
  
Invalid parameter - /D: 
  
I've no idea whats going on or how to fix it
 edit: in case anyone finds this post in the near future trying to troubleshoot this issue, I marked the post as solved but the issue is currently insolvable, drives formatted as microsoft storage spaces (regardless of the fact that it still uses NTFS) cannot be mounted on linux [yet]. My only choice seems to be reformatting the drive or just keeping it windows only.

 I have games that have run flawlessly which all of a sudden just won't even start anymore. I was playing a game literally just a few hours ago and after I did a system update it won't even boot up now.
 Doesn't matter if I am on runtime or native. I can load some games through wine, but almost nothing loads through steam any more-proton or not.
 I half suspect something with vulkan, as trying to run vulkaninfo just freezes up and does nothing.
 Other than that I don't know. I need help, if any one has help to give.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Archers,
 I would really appreciate help of Arch community with maintaining the list of packages I maintain in AUR. With almost 400 packages while I actively use approximately only about half of this number responding to "b0rked", "needs update" requests is less fun than one could imagine. Of course I could simply disown all I no longer use but I would like to take more responsible approach - see if I can get anybody else interested, add as a co-maintainer and then if it works well for some period of time step down. If you want to know if you use any of the PKGBUILDs I maintain you can run the following snippet in bash (aurutils, jq required):
 pacman -Qq | grep -xf <((aur search -r -m jose1711 | jq -r '.results|.[].Name')) 
 If you're interested in anything, please leave me a message at https://aur.archlinux.org/account/jose1711. Also I expect that you already have some experience with creating PKGBUILDs or are eager to learn.
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. Today I created my first Archlinux package using makepkg. I hope it went all right. Might someone want have a look at the PKGBUILD file? The program itself is not very complicated to install, just a single Python script to copy into a directory.
 Prior in generating the package, I have to update the checksum in PKGBUILD, upload the current state of the project to Github, create a release with a tag and change the version in the PKGBUILD file. Then I can use makepkg to build the package and upload it too in the release tab. Then one can download the "tochd-x.x-x-any.pkg.tar.zst" package from release page and install using pacman.
 Am I doing this right? The program itself is working correctly and I tested it by installing it myself (obviously). Just a note here about the program itself: It is more or less a commandline interface to automate extraction archives with 7z and convert certain types of files (such as .iso or .cue) with chdman. Intended use of generated files is for emulation of videogames.
