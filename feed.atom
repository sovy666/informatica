        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm trying to dualboot Arch and Android x86 and I have troubles getting grub to detect Android partition.
 For now I modified the /etc/grub.d/40_custom to contain
 #!/bin/sh exec tail -n +3 $0 menuentry "Android-x86" { set root='(hd2,7)' linux /android-2021-06-26/kernel quiet root=/dev/ram0 androidboot.hardware=eeepc acpi_sleep=s3_bios,s3_mode SRC=/android-2021-06-26 initrd /android-2021-06-26/initrd.img} 
 I'm not sure if my drive should be hd2,7 since I have one sata drive and two NVME drives in the system.
 I also found out about the android path name by mounting the nvme drive I installed it to and it had a folder named android-2021-06-26 inside… so I guess that's correct.
 After booting this entry grub throws an error:
 ACPI BIOS Error (bug): Failure creating name object [\_SB.PC10.SATO.PRT4._GTF], AE_ALREADY_EXISTS (20200925/dswloadZ-327) ACPI Error: AE_ALREADY_EXISTS, During name lookup/catalog (20200925/psobject-Z21) Detecting Android-x86... found at /dev/nvme0n1p7 
 But after that nothing, screen goes to black and stays like this.Keep in mind that I had to rewrite this error so I might have made some typos.
 Any help is highly appreciated!Also, I'm not entirely sure if this is the best subreddit to post this to, should I post it in a different one?

 In this post I'm going to show you how to setup an AMD GPU for Arch Linux, while it is much more straight-forward than setting up an nvidia card , new users may still benefit from this guide.
 So first you will need to have at-least functional minimal Arch Linux Installation With Networking.
 And then we will proceed :
 1 - Getting xorg Drivers.
  
Run the following Command to install xorg packages :
  
​
 sudo pacman -S xorg xorg-drivers xf86-video-amdgpu 
 2 - Getting Mesa OpenGL Drivers. (Open-source)
  
Run following Command to install mesa OpenGL packages :

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I have connected an HP ENVY 4500 multifunction device that works without problems both for printing and scanning.
 If I want to print something it does it the first time and without any problems. If I want to scan something, it always asks me for a password (and I don't care, since I'm the only one using this PC) and it never recognizes the device the first time. I need to turn my HP ENVY off and on and then yes, it recognizes it right away, and I can scan without any problems.
 I have cups.service and cups.socket enabled, as well as added my user to the sys group, apart from the wheel, but I don't really know why it doesn't recognize the computer at first and asks me for a password, something that doesn't happen with other distro: Manjaro, Endeavouros or openSUSE Tumbleweed.
 Any help to solve this problem will be very welcome, thanks. Regards, Juan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Come abbiamo messo in evidenza in tanti nostri articoli finalmente Windows 11 introduce la possibilità di installare ed eseguire 'nativamente' le app Android.L'aggettivo 'nativo' va un po’ preso con le dovute cautele: Windows 11 supporta un componente software chiamato Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA) che come WSL, usato per eseguire Linux in Windows, si appoggia alla virtualizzazione di Microsoft Hyper-V. È la virtualizzazione a essere 'nativa' nel senso che le applicazioni Android verranno eseguite direttamente sull'hardware del sistema ospitante (host).
App Android Windows 11: il modo più veloce per installare WSA
 Al momento in cui scriviamo questo articolo WSA non è stato ancora aggiunto nella versione stabile di Windows 11.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. 
 I usually use proprietary nvidia drivers at the moment it is (510.60.02). I use rtx 2080ti
 To install I use DKMS:
 sudo pacman -S nvidia-dkms nvidia-utils lib32-nvidia-utils nvidia-settings vulkan-icd-loader lib32-vulkan-icd-loader lib32-opencl-nvidia opencl-nvidia libxnvctrl
 Then:
 sudo mkinitcpio -P
 What is the problem:
 I noticed that when watching videos (for example, YouTube), my GPU is not loaded at all, but the processor is loaded.
 In this case, the browser itself starts to work more slowly when the video is running.
 This can be seen in scrolling or animations. (Like 30fps, lmao)
 With the video running, it is also noticeable how the system itself becomes slower, dragging windows and resizing them occurs as in 30fps.
 As soon as I put the video on pause - the problem does not appear.
 ​
 Please help me with this problem. Do I need to install some packages for the system to work correctly?
 ​
 pc configuration:
 AMD Ryzen 7 2700X (16) @ 4.075GHz
 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti
 RAM 32GB

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just recieved my first Tuxedo laptop and of course instantly flattened the drive and installed arch. During the install process, it already became aparent that the upper third of the screen wasn't refreshing properly.
 After setting up KDE with sddm, the issue became much more visible (because you can simply see it easier in the gui).
 I never had issues of that kind. On my other system, I'm running on NVidia with a weird uwqhd resolution and everything works fine. The Infinitybook has an Intel Iris Xe and 2880x1800 display. I've tried the fallback to the modesetting driver as stated on the Intel page in the wiki but didn't get X to launch without the xf86-video-intel package installed.
 Has anyone had similar issues? It's the first time I'm tinkering with Intel APU stuff so I don't even know what I'm really dealing with. Also, the point that the issue is also visible in the tty confuses me.
 Edit: I was able to get the issue fixed now! Thank you so much to /u/w0330 for pointing the solution out. Everything works like a charm now, in tty and KDE.
 i915.enable_psr=0 as kernel parameter was the correct solution but somehow it didn't work in the beginning, I guess because I messed something up.
 If you encounter the same issue using Intel Iris Xe graphics, try setting the given parameter, don't use xf86-video-intel and don't provide any additional launch information for xorg.

 I became interested and I decided to try the gnome for my arch.
 I use multiple monitors and previously used bspwm which allowed me to quickly and conveniently switch desktops on each of the monitors. 
 Gnome also has a feature to switch desktops for multiple monitors, but it switches the desktop on all monitors at once and this is often inconvenient. 
 Tell me, please, is there any way or extension with which I could switch desktops on each monitor separately?

Gli auricolari Bluetooth 5.0 Lenovo LivePods LP40 vengono da oggi e per pochi giorni (fino al 30 aprile prossimo) offerti in un pacchetto con 2 coppie di cuffie al prezzo scontato di 22,31 euro.

Gli auricolari sono di tipo semi in-ear e sono direttamente collegabili in modalità wireless con qualunque dispositivo mobile che supporti lo standard Bluetooth. È quindi possibile sia la gestione delle chiamate che la riproduzione dei brani musicali.Il controllo touch smart permette infatti di passare da una 'traccia' musicale all'altra (ad esempio su Spotify, Amazon Music, YouTube Music e così via) e controllare le chiamate in arrivo sul telefono accoppiato via Bluetooth usando un semplice tocco.

La base di ricarica integra una batteria da 300 mAh ed è collegabile alla presa elettrica a muro mediante un cavo USB-C.]]></summary>

Not only did this move upset customers, but Apple was sued for not including a charger, and the MagSafe Battery Pack that Apple sells instead wasn’t fast enough.

La decisa spinta sulla copertura in fibra ottica e l'uso della tecnologia VoIP per la fonia hanno indotto TIM ad avviare un importante progetto di razionalizzazione delle aree di centrale.Era il 15 settembre 1977, esattamente 40 anni fa quando l'azienda dalla quale è poi nata Telecom Italia-TIM ha posato a Torino il primo cavo in fibra ottica tra centrali telefoniche urbane. Il collegamento fu effettuato nell'ambito di un esperimento coordinato da CSELT (Centro Studi e Laboratori Telecomunicazioni), società dell'allora SIP dedicata alla ricerca e sviluppo, oggi conosciuta come TIM Open Lab.Oggi la fibra ottica è utilizzata a vari livelli tanto che si parla di molteplici schemi FTTx per il collegamento degli abbonati. Abbiamo anche visto cos'è la fibra ottica monomodale e come funziona.Proprio da Torino TIM è partita con il progetto di efficientamento delle centrali: l'azienda ha infatti dismesso il sito di Corso Bramante che occupava circa 5.000 m2 e che gestiva diverse migliaia di collegamenti voce e dati.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google ha in programma di dare una spallata finale alle app di terze parti che permettono di registrare le chiamate su Android. A partire dal prossimo 11 maggio anche le ultime applicazioni che ancora permettevano di registrare le conversazioni telefoniche non funzioneranno più.Il 'cambio di rotta' è stato introdotto con l'aggiunta di una nuova policy nel Play Store: l'obiettivo è proprio quello di 'tagliare le gambe' alle app per la registrazione delle chiamate sviluppate e pubblicate da soggetti terzi.Fino ad oggi, infatti, le applicazioni che permettevano di registrare le chiamate Android usavano una 'gabola' che consisteva nel richiamare le API di accessibilità sui dispositivi mobili. D'ora in avanti le app pubblicate sul Play Store non saranno più autorizzate a servirsi di tali API.Lo stesso meccanismo potrà invece essere utilizzato dall'app Google Telefono e da tutti i dialer sviluppati e preinstallati dai produttori di smartphone sui loro dispositivi Android.Come abbiamo visto nell'articolo su come registrare le chiamate Android con Google Telefono la funzionalità, disponibile anche in Italia, riproduce il messaggio vocale 'Questa chiamata viene ora registrata' al momento dell'attivazione.In realtà tale messaggio non sarebbe neppure necessario: la registrazione di una telefonata alla quale si è preso parte è ammessa come prova anche in sede legale ed è quindi uno strumento di difesa nei confronti di terzi (abusi, minacce, insulti, ricatti,...).Secondo la giurisprudenza non è necessario avvisare l'interlocutore circa la registrazione della chiamata a patto che il registrante partecipi alla conversazione.]]></summary>

 It came with a 512GB Samsung NVMe. I got a second 2TB NVMe. Windows recognized it just fine and initialized it with GPT then I split it in half and set the first half as NTFS and left the second half unallocated.
 In arch however, the drive is not showing up at all. It doesn't appear in /dev, with lsblk, or with nvme list. 
 Following info found online, I checked my bios, and it doesn't appear that any fastboot/raid/rapid storage mode is set. And it seems to be set to AHCI mode.
 So why can only Arch not see the drive?

And everytime I install and use Cinnamon my CPU use goes ~20% on idle and the temperature goes up. Not even KDE uses as much CPU (although it takes 30s to load in my old-ass laptop). Does anybody else has noticed the same?

Before you start replacing your memory or computer, use the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool to figure out if the memory really is the problem. While Windows may sometimes suggest using the tool after a problem, you can also use the troubleshooter manually to diagnose issues.

 Yo guys, i was building a products management panel using php.
 The default php location is /usr/bin/php 
 But phpstorm and other programs cannot recognize the php executable on /usr/bin
 I have vscode and phpstorm installed in my computer, then when i try to configure CLI interpreters on phpstorm or php executable's path on vscode with php server extensions they acts as if cant recognize php executable file on path, but i already have lastest php version installed !!
 How can i solve it?
 I really tried everything... but any of them worked :
 - Downgrading
 - Change executable's directory
 - Execute them as sudo
 - Reinstall php

The Sensyne 10″ Ring Light with Tripod is extendable, features LED circle lights, and has a phone holder to leave your hands free to lead instruction or just enjoy a cup of coffee while you chat.
    
The right light includes a high-sensitivity touch panel with a longer life than what you would have with mechanical buttons. It allows you to adjust the color mode between cool white, warm yellow, and daylight and has 10 brightness levels. The color and brightness options will help all users but will work especially well for makeup tutorials.
    

    
The AC/DC adapter improves the brightness of the Sensyne 10″ Ring Light with Tripod by more than 50% over USB models. Extend the spring-loaded phone holder up to 5.3″ wide to fit nearly all smartphones, even if you leave your case on, and rotate it a full 360º.

Whenever I type grub-install /dev/nvme0n1 it says Error: EFI partiton not found. I can circumvent this by changing “nvme0n1p1” to /mnt/boot/efi, but then when I execute the command again, it spits out Error: eftbootmgr not found.
  
How could I make it so that grub-install works when “nvme0n1p1 is mounted to /mnt/boot ?
 How can I fix the main problem I am running in to?

 See the "dwarf fortress" text in the address bar. it is so bad it looks like "dwar f for tress". Everything else mostly looks fine in firefox it seems to be the address bar particularly that has the issue. My searchign about for a solution on and off for the last year has never found a solution, but my searching for something related to dwarf fortress there was the last bloody straw.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AKASO has become well-known for being a reliable mid-range alternative to more expensive action cameras. With the AKASO Brave 8, the brand looks to become a true competitor among higher-end action cams. I recently had the opportunity to test out this new 4K camera myself, which was a great excuse to get out and about during some cold winter days.

Overview of Features
    
The AKASO Brave 8 Action Camera doesn’t skimp on features. In fact, the feature set can easily rival its more expensive competitors. It offers an impressive 4K resolution at 60fps, though this can be adjusted depending on your needs. It also supports 12 MP and 48 MP photos.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. Im trying to install arch on my SD card in order to have a pi with arch but I stumbled upon some issues.
 I did the proper fdisk stuff (following this tutorial), but while I was trying to mkfs.vfat my /dev/sdc1 partition it was spitting out: unable to sunchronize input/output error
 later I did dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdc bs=1024 count=1024 but it didint help.
 Now when I try to mkfs it spits out this:
 Buffer I/O error on dev sdc1, logical block (numbers from 0 to 40), lost async page write I/O error, dev sdc, sector 2288 op 0x1:(WRITE) flags 0x800 phys_seg 1 prio class 0 I/O error, dev sdc, sector 2296 op 0x1:(WRITE) flags 0x100000 phys_seg 24 prio class 0 mkfs.vfat: unable to synchronize /dev/sdc1:Input/output error 
 smartctl -a /dev/sdc shows: Unknown USB bridge [0x1e3d:0x4083 (0x100)]
 The SD card ran Debian just fine for long time so I'm 100% sure it's working and not damaged.
 I'm pretty sure I just fucked up some sectors or something
 I'll be more than happy if someone will be able to help me fix this
 edit:
 did sudo smartctl -a -d scsi -T permisive /dev/sdd and it returned this

A fine 2011 la Mela ha deciso di rendere ALAC un codec open source aprendo così la strada all'integrazione dello stesso in molteplici dispositivi e programmi di riproduzione audio non-Apple, tra cui smartphone basati su Android, lettori multimediali Linux e Windows e convertitori.Apple ha aggiornato la versione del decoder per il formato ALAC diverse volte correggendo i problemi di sicurezza via via emersi.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quando si lavora con Windows può essere utile acquisire un'immagine che rappresenti ciò che è visualizzato sullo schermo. Creare uno screenshot può essere utile, ad esempio, per salvare un messaggio d'errore o per mostrare a un altro utente la procedura da seguire per risolvere un problema. Ancora, catturare la schermata di Windows può risultare necessario per copiare e incollare altrove un contenuto che diversamente non è selezionabile e non può essere trasferito usando gli Appunti.Fortunatamente per creare screenshot in Windows 11 si possono usare la maggior parte degli strumenti disponibili nelle precedenti versioni del sistema operativo Microsoft.
Copiare i messaggi di Windows 11 senza creare screenshot
 Cominciamo con un trucco che per molti potrebbe risultare davvero utile: in caso di errori restituiti dai tradizionali programmi Win32 o dall'interfaccia (shell di Windows, alias Esplora file), non quindi quelli provenienti dal Microsoft Store, si può copiare il testo visualizzato in finestra premendo semplicemente CTRL+C.Provate a premere Windows+R quindi digitate Z:\ o la lettera di un'unità di memorizzazione inesistente.Windows 11 mostrerà un messaggio d'errore: per copiarne il contenuto in formato testo basta premere CTRL+C.Aprendo il Blocco Note (Windows+R, notepad), Wordpad, Word, LibreOffice, il client di posta elettronica, Gmail o qualunque altro software che accetta l'inserimento di testo, la combinazione di tasti CTRL+V consente di copiare il testo del messaggio visualizzato in precedenza da parte di Windows.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I multiboot a few linux distros and windows with separate /boot and /home partitions. On the very first installation of arch linux everything went great, but after some time I messed up with nvidia drivers(lost control of DE) so I decided to reinstall the system. So I formatted the arch partition and tried to install it again. For an irrelevant(for this problem) reason I didn't install any boot manager and when I booted into arch, rescue shell showed up. So I formatted the partition again and installed arch with grub. This time after selecting arch message
  
Failed to mount /boot
  
showed up. I tried to mount it with mount /dev/sda2 /boot but i got message:
  
unknown filesystem vfat
  
So I tried to reinstall arch accurately paying attention to every element of installation (I did it exactly like the very first time), but the same problem occurred.
 What is worth mentioning that Ethernet connection also stopped working. Nevertheless the grub that is showing when I start my computer is the one from Zorin OS (if that changes anything).
 What can I do to successfully mount /boot partition on startup?
