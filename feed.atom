 I followed these instructions but when I boot and I'm prompted for a passphrase I try tapping the key and it sits thinking for a minute then returns;

 What am I missing?
 All I did was enroll it, which said it used slot 1 and then added the volume to crypttab like the page said..
 I must be missing something.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was thinking that while I have a usb stick with archiso that I can use to salvage my computer back into working order I might not always have the stick at hand. And it kinda happened yesterday, it took me 10min tops to fix things but I had to go home.
 I was thinking that maybe I could dump the archiso into a partition on my harddrive and basically setup an "immutable" recovery partition that I can always boot into if I mess up my primary installation, arch-chroot from there and fix things.
 Does this make sense? If not, why and what do you suggest instead? If it does, are there any nice guides I can follow or will I have to wing it and potentially write my own guide (I'll share it here if I do)

 Right now, the keyboard volume up and down change the volume by a step of 5%. This is good amount for pressable volume keys, but mine is a pretty sensitive scroller, so I would like to lower the size of this step. 
 I have only found solutions for Gnome and XFCE (such as this one) , but I'm not using any DEs, only I3wm. I don't even know where the binding for the volume key is tbh as I'm pretty noob at linux (specially Arch), so any ideas on how to achieve this will be welcome
 ​
 Infos (if you need more just ask):
 - I'm using pipewire-pulse (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PipeWire).

 Is this true or did I misunderstand the whole thing?
 Is this a standard practice?
 How do I do this? Do I just install LTS from the repos, do nothing else to it and go on with my life or do I have to do some extra configuration to make it actually useful in case something actually goes wrong with the stable kernel?

 In minecraft (using optifine), several different shaders seem to be running into different problems themselves. These striped shadows as shown in the screenshots appear in all of them and they only go away once i turn off every shadow related option to minimum.
 In Second Life (with Alchemy viewer) turning on Advanced Lighting Model has a similar effect, as you can see in pictures.
 I suspect is an OpenGL issue since both features previously mention make use of it.
 This visual glitch, however, is not present at all on games like Cyberpunk 2077, Metro Exodus EE, Elden Ring (all run with Proton Steam), and every GPU feature seem…]]></summary>

I soon came to figure out that after my computer boots, Bluetooth will not work unless I close the lid and re-open. It then works fine. At first, I assumed it was a hardware issue. I went as far as opening the laptop and reseating the module (which also handles Wi-Fi, which had no issues). I then learned that when it is in that state where it cannot detect the adapter, plugging in an external adapter also fails to be detected. Anyone heard of this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vi sarà certamente capitato, nell'esaminare le specifiche delle unità SSD in commercio, di imbattervi in dati che fotografano una situazione all'apparenza piuttosto strana: le unità a stato solido più capienti sono più veloci rispetto a quelli di dimensione inferiore.I dati non possono certo essere oggetto di discussione perché sono dichiarati dagli stessi produttori e riguardano modelli di SSD appartenenti alla medesima linea di prodotto (differiscono solamente per la rispettiva capienza).Certo, sappiamo bene che i dati pubblicati dai produttori spesso si discostano da quelli rilevati, in situazioni reali, da parte degli utenti. E quando si parla di SSD sono tante le tecnologie che rendono più veloci le unità a stato solido.Ma perché gli SSD sono più lenti se meno capienti?
Cosa significa IOPS
 Prendiamo in esame il valore IOPS nelle operazioni di lettura e scrittura random 4K delle unità SSD.IOPS, innanzi tutto, è acronimo di Input/Output Operations Per Second (si pronuncia eye-ops): si tratta di un valore che esprime il numero di operazioni che l'unità presa in esame è in grado di compiere in un secondo.Il valore di IOPS rilevato può comunque variare sulla base di molteplici fattori: la tipologia di operazioni di lettura e scrittura, il mix di modelli di accesso sequenziale e casuale, il numero di thread, la profondità della coda di lavoro, le dimensioni dei blocchi di dati, la configurazione del sistema, i driver, le operazioni svolte in background dal sistema operativo.Con la specifica IOPS viene data un'idea delle prestazioni di un SSD durante la lettura/scrittura dei dati random 4K posto che le performance di queste unità superano per ordini di grandezza quelle dei tradizionali hard disk magnetomeccanici.In un altro articolo abbiamo descritto le principali differenze tra hard disk e SSD.
Perché un SSD meno capiente è meno veloce?
 Abbiamo già rilevato come le unità SSD meno capienti siano dichiarate come meno prestazionali rispetto a quelle di maggiori dimensioni.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am experiencing issues with my setup. Most of the time my system boots just fine and everything is good.
 However, in 2% of the times where I boot up my system, my second monitor is not being recognized.Running xrandr --listmonitors only shows my main display. Running xrandr | grep ' connected' also shows nothing but the main screen.
 The display also not recognized before logging in during SDDM.
 This issue can be solved many times by rebooting once, twice, ... n-times but it is annoying as I need a stable system.
 This issue also persisted across different "versions"; i am updating my system at least every two weeks.
 How can this be solved?
 P.S.: Although my account is a bit older, I don't have much experience with reddit. If there is anything to improve the question let me know. 
 EDIT: The second display is a bit older and takes some time to react when receiving new input. Is the issue, perhaps, that my system boots too fast?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As title states, I am having an issue with CJK characters in Chromium apps. They work perfectly fine in KDE apps such as panels and Dolphin, and Firefox renders them fine as well. However, Spotify, Discord, and Chromium all do not have font smoothing for these characters and they look ugly.
 Here is a comparison: https://i.imgur.com/xYUDY13.png
 Also, my related post on r/kde on this topic: https://old.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/v8wpuv/why_does_japanese_text_have_smoothing_and_looks/
 I figure if I can fix the fonts in Chromium, they should start working fine in Electron apps too.
 For the record, I have the following fonts installed on the system:
 noto-fonts-cjk
 adobe-source-han-sans-jp-fonts
 adobe-source-han-serif-jp-fonts
 otf-ipafont

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been playing around in NixOS for the last few days and I really like the concept of a config file handling everything that you have on your computer to the point where if you take that one file and install NixOS on another computer with that config file, everything that's on the other computer will be on the new computer. Sort of like duplicating the system.
 Is there a way to do this with Arch (or any other distro for that matter)? I'm sure that feature is built into NixOS but is there a program to install during a basic Arch installation that will use a config file to install all of your needed packages? I know a script will do it but it's kind of neat having a config file that sets up your network, desktop environment, time, etc as well as install all of your programs.

L'idea era quella di mettere a punto un sistema che tutti potessero utilizzare, per rendere l'informatica più popolare e proporre un'interfaccia user-friendly.I due riuscirono nell'intento se si considera che il successo commerciale fu enorme per quei tempi con più di 5 milioni di esemplari complessivamente venduti.Il modello originale poggiava il suo funzionamento su una CPU MOS 6502 a 1 MHz, offriva una grafica a colori, con una matrice del testo pari a 40 x 24 caratteri, uscita video composita, interfaccia a cassetta per l'archiviazione e otto slot di espansione interni.Veniva venduto in configurazioni variabili che andavano da 1.298 dollari con una dotazione di 4 KB di RAM a 2.638 dollari per 48 KB di RAM.]]></summary>
