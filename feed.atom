I will create '@','@home','@cache' for /var/cache,'@boot'. and what I want to do is to exclude the '@cache' and '@home' when creating snapshots as i don't wanna take a snapshot of cache files and my own files (I have them backed up elsewhere).
 Is this possible ? and if yes, How to do it ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using secure boot with systemd to auto-decrypt my LUKS system partition on boot for about a year on all my bare metal arch systems, but my headless server has been having issues since 251.1-1 was installed. My desktop and laptop auto-decrypt just fine. BIOS version hasn't changed between systemd updates. It's using AMD fTPM.
 251.2-1 hit my server but the issue continues. When systemd-boot reaches the disk decryption for root, it takes 5 seconds to run two cryptsetup jobs (without error) to decrypt as if it's working, but then prompts for a passphrase. If I wipe the TPM2 slot, it skips that 2-job step and instantly prompts for passphrase. Entering the passphrase will allow the boot to continue successfully.
 I'm using PCRs 0 and 7, and they have the exact same values after each boot according to tpm2_pcrread.
 I tried enrolling with option --tpm2-with-pin=no, clearing TPM from BIOS, enabling all sha1 and sha256 banks, wiping tpm2 cryptenroll slots and turning TPM off + power cycling and setting it all up again but still no progress. It's always the same 5 sec cryptsetup jobs that results in a LUKS passphrase prompt. My systemd-boot entry hasn't changed since I first set it up, and the rd.luks options are all the exact same from when it worked before.
 Tried to re-cryptenroll the root by sdX and by-uuid. A secondary storage disk decrypts using crypttab just fine (using keyfile, not TPM).
 Output of bootctl status seems good:
 System: Firmware: UEFI 2.70 (American Megatrends 5.17) Secure Boot: enabled (user) TPM2 Support: yes Boot into FW: supported Current Boot Loader: Product: systemd-boot 251.2-1-arch 
 I can't find any related errors in journalctl, where else could I troubleshoot this issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I installed arch on my new laptop, and i'm currently on the latest release with kernel 5.18. I need to use some virtual machines, but after trying virtual box, it appears I'm running into an issue because the kernel is 5.18 and isn't supported yet by virtual box. I then tried Qemu/KVM and I ran into an issue where I can't bridge my wireless interface, as that isn't supported by KVM. I also don't have previous versions of arch installed as it's fresh so I'm struggling to find a way to downgrade the kernel (and tbh, I don't really wanna do that anyway, I'd rather not have the headaches). Like, what to do?

Il problema riguarda la percentuale dell'indicatore di carica della batteria dell'iPhone, che può essere completamente sballato, passare dal 45% al 12% in un secondo o, viceversa, passare da 18% al 43% un secondo dopo averlo messo in carica. In pratica l'iPhone si scarica subito, anche se teoricamente avrebbe dovuto durare di più, come se la batteria fosse fallata.
 In altri casi, può capitare che dopo aver tenuto in carica tutta la notte il telefono, lo si prenda la mattina e lo si ritrovi scarico o quasi. Se anche noi siamo vittime di un iPhone che si scarica subito o che mostra una durata della carica completamente sballata, vediamo insieme come fare per calibrare la batteria e farla durare di più.

 However, firefox cannot access any external content at all when connected to the VPN. Sites just timeout.
 Chromium can bring up google and even do google searches, but it's a 50/50 shot whether a site will load. 
 If I try to do a pacman -Sy on the VPN, it seems to load (slowly), but then fails out saying all the downloads timed out.
 Network admin says that it shows my HTTP requests going out just fine, but somehow they don't make it back to my laptop.
 Those using Windows don't have this issue, so I'm stuck having to fix this myself.
 Anyone have any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I am trying to run a simple cron job, which checks my battery status every 5 minutes, and if the battery level is below a certain percentage or above a certain percentage, it sends a notification using dunstify. I have installed cronie and postfix, and also exported my DISPLAY variable and PATH. But, it doesn't seem to work. The following is the log,
 ​
 Unable to send notification: Error spawning command line “dbus-launch --autolaunch=0a0346fd261a47c585e85476f8e10480 --binary-syntax --close-stderr”: Child process exited with code 1 Unable to send notification: Error spawning command line “dbus-launch --autolaunch=0a0346fd261a47c585e85476f8e10480 --binary-syntax --close-stderr”: Child process exited with code 1 Unable to send notification: Error spawning command line “dbus-launch --autolaunch=0a0346fd261a47c585e85476f8e10480 --binary-syntax --close-stderr”: Child process exited with code 1 Unable to send notification: Error spawning command line “dbus-launch --autolaunch=0a0346fd261a47c585e85476f8e10480 --binary-syntax --close-stderr”: Child process exited with code 1 
 ​
 The link to my script: https://pastebin.com/DGcSfRuC
 ​
 And, this is my crontab entry,
 */5 * * * * env DISPLAY=:0 && /home/ruturajn/.local/bin/bat_val >> /tmp/cron_bat_val_log.txt 2>&1
 I have made the script executable, and it works perfectly, when I run it normally, in the terminal. So could someone help me out with this?
 ​
 Thanks
 ​
 Edit:
 I figured it out, I had to add these two lines at the beginning of my script,
 ​
 export DISPLAY=:0 export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/run/user/1000/bus 
 ​
 It works now, Thanks for all your suggestions.

In alternativa basta premere Windows+X e scegliere Gestione dispositivi.Può capitare di voler rimuovere driver che causano problemi: come fare per disinstallare i componenti software correlati dal sistema in uso?Innanzi tutto osserviamo che la finestra Gestione dispositivi mostra l'elenco completo dell'hardware in uso con l'indicazione (verificare la presenza di apposite icone) degli elementi non riconosciuti, disattivati oppure che creano problemi.

Nell'esempio tutti i componenti hardware sono correttamente riconosciuti da parte di Windows: soltanto ExpressVPN Tap Adapter mostra l'icona che viene visualizzata nel caso di dispositivi disattivati.]]></summary>

I have read the wiki page at https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dual_boot_with_Windows and reading information online and on reddit, I have made a backup of my data with rsync, I have 1.5 TB of empty partition ready to be allocated, but I can't bring myself to actually go and dualboot.
 This thread and this thread seems to suggest that the EFI partition will be overwritten, and even after reading the wiki I'm not really sure what to actually do to pull this off correctly and how to fix any issues as they arise.
 Some users are suggesting to just install windows willy nilly (I'm certain this is guaranteed to cause issues I won't know how to fix)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys.
 Right now at home I'm hosting a custom package repository for Archlinux in which I build packages from AUR and some custom packages that I use regularly.
 My setup
 I'm using a Swag container to serve the packages, Cloudflare as my DNS provider and a container with aurutils to build my packages.
 The situation
 Right now my custom repository is accessible from the internet (which is something I want) and people with the URL of the repository can use it.
 Scope
 What I would like to achieve is to restrict the access to my custom repository pretty much like SSH key autentication when remoting inside a machine. I don't want random people to begin using my repository, but only a few, even if they have the URL.
 Possible solutions
 VPN and Virtual interface
 Right now the only idea I have in mind is making the repository accessible only through a VPN, and setup a virtual interface on my machine to the VPN so that I don't get those annoying messages saying that the download of the database has failed.
 XferCommand
 https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=237687
 SSHFS
 Not my favourite 
 Any suggestion about how you would achieve this?
 Solution
 As one of the commenters suggested, I think I will go for HTTP basic authentication which seems to be what I was looking for.

 Here is what I see.
 This issue cropped up a few weeks ago at random, and after extensive googling and asking on the AUR - I'm fresh out of ideas.
 Some context on the issue:
  
Screensharing works fine in Zoom, so this must be a teams issue (perhaps I am missing some dependency?)
 
The issue persists in the browser (tried with firefox and mircosoft edge)
 
Issue persists with both AUR packages (teams and teams-for-linux)
 
Issue persists after uninstalling teams, deleting .cache and reinstalling
 
Installed an xdg-desktop-portal package (GNOME) and this did not fix the issue (it did break firefox however)
 
 I really need to get this sorted for work, or I'm going to have to switch away from Arch unfortunately. Does anyone have any suggestions?

 Problem Description
 Firefox, Chromium, Slack, and other applications are displaying monospaced font as regular, sans-serif fonts (screenshot). To my surprise, monospaced fonts still work on some websites, like archlinux.org (screenshot). Using Web Developer Tools in Firefox it is possible to see that the font resolution is clearly messed up in the left (Github) and not on the right (screenshot).
 Attempted Fixes
  
Tried reinstalling fontconfig and all applications where fonts are not working, didn't work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What the title says.
 I run Sway WM, use Nemo as my FM and like the mix of the two. I checked Thunar and it too shows the damn partition twice in my sidebar just like Nemo does. It's very weird. It also allows one to unmount the partition but I suppose that's normal? I've never used Nemo or Thunar until this particular install. Quite a strange issue.
 I do have udev automounting that partition as evidenced by a simple mount |grep data which gives me this:
 ↪ mount|grep data systemd-1 on /data type autofs (rw,relatime,fd=48,pgrp=1,timeout=0,minproto=5,maxproto=5,direct,pipe_ino=17512) /dev/nvme0n1p4 on /data type btrfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,ssd,discard,space_cache,commit=60,subvolid=5,subvol=/,x-systemd.automount,x-gvfs-show) 
 Could this be the issue? Further information in case it helps:
 ↪ lsblk -l NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS nvme0n1 259:0 0 238.5G 0 disk nvme0n1p1 259:1 0 300M 0 part /boot nvme0n1p2 259:2 0 73.2G 0 part / nvme0n1p3 259:3 0 73.2G 0 part /home nvme0n1p4 259:4 0 81.9G 0 part /data nvme0n1p5 259:5 0 9.8G 0 part [SWAP]

One of the more useful features is the ability to link your debit and credit cards. Doing so will enable you to use Google Pay to track your spending, making balancing your checkbook and budgeting your money super easy.
    
Google Pay is in the middle of another makeover. It has been rebranded, again, as Google Wallet in certain countries. However, Google Pay users in US and Canada can continue to use the app, albeit with a different name, for tracking expenses and budgeting.

Systemd-login would try to start X, but would kick me back to login after "cannot connect to xserver: bad file descriptor". I tried to troubleshoot via other TTY, and read up on the usage of Xorg.wrap if launching X with root is required, but haven't had any luck yet.
 I read https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/xorg#Rootless_Xorg and tried to get it going with that, but no luck.
 I'm pretty sure this has to do with the change of rootles xorg by default. To verify, I booted up my other system, which has lightdm running with bspwm. After updating, it just goes to a black screen with a frozen cursor at the top left.
 I thought I'd see other people mentioning this, but nothing yet.

 I'm running Arch with KDE as an X11 session and Waterfox as my default browser. Whenever I click on links from other applications (e.g. Discord or even the help page links in base programs like my System settings) it opens a new tab with the file index of my home folder. In some cases I can copy the link and paste it in a new tab and that works just fine but it's still a problem for me that I want to have fixed. 
 I looked up some pages but most of them have the same issue but are running a Wayland session, while I am on X11. Anyone else encountered this problem, and if yes, how did you fix it? 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I was wondering how to make systemd boot ask for the passphrase of more than just one (the root) device, so I could balance the root to a RAID and be sure that all the disks get decrypted at bootup. Sadly I was not able to find any information on this, so I thought I would just ask it in here. 
 Does the bootloader detect the RAID member structure on the sepcified root drive and is it maybe able to trace the remaining member disks of the RAID, so it would automatically ask me to decrypt all?
 Or is there anything I need to specify for example in the boot options for this to work?
 ​
 I am using systemd-boot with an unencrypted vfat efi partition. My root is on a btrfs partition and I am planning to stretch the root fs to make a RAID of three disks. 
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After rebooting my pc it got stuck at booting, I'm using btrfs with subvolumes for home, opt, tmp, .snapshots (which I don't use) and var. And this is everything that happened:
 So I just rebooted my pc and it got stuck with the message Staring version 251.2-1-arch, but I could switch to other TTYs, login on them and the filesystem seemed normal. So I just created a snapshot with timeshift and restored one of 5 days ago, I just got an error saying E: Unable to remove directory at the end but I ignored it.
 Then I rebooted and after the message of Starting version... I got two errors, one saying that it failed to start kernel modules and other saying that failed to mount /boot so I just changed /boot mount options from /etc/fstab file to defaults but just threw me into recovery mode, I also removed the option subvolid in all subvolumes in fstab (because it caused problems with the /home subvolume before) and even tried commenting the line that mounts /boot which leaves me with Failed to start kernel modules but I can switch to other TTYs an all filesystem seems normal.
 After all I just restored to the snapshot created by default before restoring (it has the /boot line commented in /etc/fstab, and it got errors sayng something about failed to mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 (the /boot partition) in /run/timeshift/.../boot) but continued anyway and after rebooting I got an error with Failed to start kernel modules again but the system tried to start a graphical interface in TTY-7 and I was able to switch to TTYs.
 The only things I did on that session were: * Install librewolf with pacaur, but didn't even finished because some package validation failed. * Clone the virtual-display-linux into /opt/virtual-display-linux and tried running it, it said me to reboot. * Download the AppImage of deskreen to /opt/deskreen/Deskreen.AppImage and used it.
 Can someone tell me how to restore any snapshot that works??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the last 4 years or so, since I use this computer, the entropy in /dev/random was around 3600 (except right after a reboot). However, since a few days, the entropy is stuck at 256 (it doesn't fluctuate anymore either, which is a different behavior compared to before).
 The command I use to check the entropy level is cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail
 which I know lowers a very tiny bit the entropy, or at least used to, but an entropy stuck at 256 is a first for me. I do update my system almost daily, so maybe a Linux kernel update changed this behavior. I was wondering whether it's normal, what's going, and why it is stuck at that level.
 Thanks.

 Synology provide an rpm, and a deb for download, but not entirely sure whether I should try installing this onto arch (I've heard it's tied to your kernel version anyway). 
 Likewise there's nothing in the AUR, although plenty of other Synology apps there.
 Has anyone got this working?

 Basically I am trying to map a steam controller to keyboard events, but I want to add my own logic via python.
 I can either have steam map the controller to keyboard events, then consume those and output new key events, or just have steam output controller events (not sure what protocol this is) and consume those.
 I need the events to be input and output globally, as this is a control layer i want for all apps.
 Any advice is appreciated, thanks!

I use OpenVPN connected to a VPN service (using the regular OpenVPN daemon) and use NetworkManager to manage my Ethernet connection. I do not use the OpenVPN NetworkManager plugin.
 I can attribute this to DNS as trying to ping a domain name will have ping sometimes wait for about 30 seconds before looking up the domain and pinging OK, however pinging an Internet IP address has no issues. Disconnecting OpenVPN will cease the issues.
 Has anyone else had this issue?
 edit:: downgrading to OpenVPN 2.5.6 seems to have fixed the issue for now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It has been for about a month. It's flagged as outdated, but there's no way to track progress on updating it. The issue is delta uses the syntax highlight cache created by bat. bat introduced a breaking change to this cache in v0.21. delta was updated to work with this cache update in v0.13, but it's not backwards compatible with the old cache format. the git-delta package was update to v0.13, but bat is stuck on v0.20. 
 What's the process for getting a community package updated save marking it as outdated? I thought opening a bug would be the correct course of action, but the bug list explicitly says not to do that for outdated packages. I'm happy to update the package myself if the maintainer is busy, I just need to know where to start.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft Outlook is one of the most widely used email clients on the market. Many companies use it because of all of the tools and signature customizations it includes, while some people use it for their personal email because you can combine up to 20 email addresses into a single Outlook account and access them all simultaneously. What’s more, Outlook includes many other productivity tools, like a calendar, task manager, and note-taking.
    
While there are definitely benefits to using Outlook, it sometimes takes forever to navigate through the endless menu options to perform simple functions. Luckily, there are keyboard shortcuts to perform nearly every function within Outlook if you learn them. Of course, you don’t have to master them all right away – you can just take advantage of this list of Microsoft Outlook keyboard shortcuts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I motivi per cui un PC si spegne da solo possono essere i più diversi. Di solito, però, la causa può essere hardware, software o esterna (ad esempio uno sbalzo di tensione o un blackout elettrico, più o meno breve).Cosa verificare se si verifica uno spegnimento improvviso del PC? Innanzi tutto è opportuno controllare, con gli strumenti software forniti dal produttore della scheda madre, e con il Visualizzatore eventi di Windows lo stato delle cose.
Spegnimento improvviso del PC o schermata blu
 Quando si presenta un errore critico Windows genera una schermata blu e provvede a riavviare oppure a spegnere il sistema in uso. Per questo motivo spesso non ci si accorge nemmeno della schermata blu che non appare stabilmente a video.Per ovviare a questo problema e avere il tempo materiale, in caso di comparsa di una schermata blu, di leggere e annotare il messaggio d'errore restituito, basta premere Windows+R, digitare sysdm.cpl ,3, cliccare su Impostazioni nel riquadro Avvio e ripristino quindi disattivare la casella Riavvia automaticamente.

In un altro articolo abbiamo visto cosa può provocare una schermata blu o BSOD (Blue-screen-of-Death) e come risalire all'errore restituito da Windows.Nell'articolo abbiamo presentato l'utilità BlueScreenView che estrae dal registro degli eventi di Windows tutti quelli riferibili alla comparsa di una schermata blu.In alternativa si può premere Windows+X quindi scegliere Windows PowerShell (amministratore) in Windows 10 o Terminale Windows (Admin) in Windows 11 quindi impartire il seguente comando:$ErrorActionPreference='SilentlyContinue'; Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{logname='Application';id=1001}Si otterrà la lista delle schermate blu eventualmente comparse.]]></summary>

Having your computer set up exactly as you like can make the difference between getting work done smoothly and dragging through something that’d otherwise be simple. Your keyboard and its layout are a major factor here, whether you’re writing, coding, or just relying on hotkeys.
    
Even though they all have their own ways of handling it, every Linux desktop environment makes it simple to customize your keyboard layout for your language, region, and personal preference.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I recently got a new work station, and it has an and rx 640 (absolute powerhouse, I know). Everything works great except that I can only get a display if I disable dynamic power mode. Recently my pc has started to completely lock up when I leave the pc alone for more than 10 minutes, requiring a force restart. The only thing that makes sense to me is that these two options are linked and the gpu is causing issues. I have three monitors and when I try to wake the machine, one turns on but the other two remain off and the entire setup freezes. I have scoured the net for this one, setting amdgpu in the mkinitcpio hooks, swapping drivers moving my install to a brand new but identical machine etc. Has anyone else had any luck with overcoming this issue? Thanks.
