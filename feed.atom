        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use grub and I mount my EFI partition at /efi. But every time I boot my system I get this weird start time for dev-disk-by uuid for that partition:
 dev-disk-by\x2duuid-E608\x2d77AE.device @584542y 2w 2d 20h 1min 48.724s +1.274s
 Like, my PC did not take over half a million years to boot. 
 This is its line in the fstab. It was generated automatically by genfstab while installing Arch.
 UUID=E608-77AE /efi vfat rw,relatime,fmask=0022,dmask=0022,codepage=437,iocharset=ascii,shortname=mixed,utf8,errors=remount-ro 0 2
 That EFI partition was created by Windows 11 when I installed it on an empty SSD, then I installed Arch in the remaining space. I don't know if that may be relevant.
 Do you know how I can start to diagnose this weird issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Who's this guide for: people with windows system that got another ssd and they want to put linux in it. And they want to use systemd-boot instead of GRUB.
 ​
 STEP 1
 Disable fast boot and then secure boot.
 If it is greyed out then try rebooting after disabling fast boot.
 If it is still greyed out you might need to set an admin UEFI password or there's some other feature in the UEFI that uses secure boot.
 ​
 STEP 2
 Install linux on the new ssd, make sure to double check it's the correct one. You gotta also format it from the installer, archlinux has that option too. 
 Usually, you can easily detect the new SSD because it has all it's space as free space too, whereas a windows SSD will have something different.
 P.S. I downloaded archinstall with pacman and then used that to install archlinux. Recommended for new users.
 ​
 STEP 3
 After linux installation finished.
 Type "sudo fdisk -l" in the terminal and you'll see a partition that says EFI System at the end of the row. Take the device of that row, e.g. "/dev/nvme1n1p1"
 Type "sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1p1 /mnt" but instead of /dev/nvme1n1p1 put your own device partition path.
 Then "cd /mnt/EFI"
 Then "cp -R ./Microsoft /boot/EFI"
 ​
 ​
 That's it. It's so simple with systemd-boot and it works flawlessly for me. In this way Archlinux is in charge of the boot and after booting you computer you'll have few seconds to pick an OS.
 ​
 ​
 This is a barebone guide, please be careful when doing anything as you're responsible for your device not me. And some things may be different based on person to person case.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey ppl,
 Hope this question belongs here.
 So has saying on the title, got a Lenovo X250 with a dock which is connected to 2 screens. 1 is with VGA and the other DVI-HDMI converter and then HDMI to the screen. Got a 3rd output not used which is DP, iirc VGI and DP are "together". So the VGAS screen works perfectly but the VGI-HDMI screen randomly turn black for 1-2 seconds and then comes back normally.
 On my .xinit file got this 2 lines:
 mons -S 5,4:R
 mons primary DP2-2
 VGA screen 1080p 60Hz
 HDMI screen 1440p 60Hz
 Has any1 had this problem before?

archlinux installation with this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8YPS2itHfU
 a part of this video for sway installation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t_v-zBbwbo (my error occurs at 5:00)
  
So when I tried to start sway (just like the guy in the 2nd video did at https://youtu.be/2t_v-zBbwbo?t=300), the terminal send me some errors that looks like this:
 [rubi@archlinux ~]$ sway 00:00:00.001 [wlr] [libseat] [libseat/libseat.c:79] No backend was able to open a seat 00:00:00.001 [wlr] [backend/session/session.c:84] Unable to create seat: Function not implemented 00:00:00.001 [wlr] [backend/session/session.c:249] Failed to load session backend 00:00:00.001 [wlr] [backend/backend.c:86] Failed to start a session 00:00:00.001 [wlr] [backend/backend.c:352] Failed to start a DRM session 00:00:00.002 [sway/server.c:56] Unable to create backend [rubi@archlinux ~]$ 
 Does anyone know what I did wrong? I just followed the exact orders from those tutorials. The only thing I changed was the screen resolution in the ~/.config/sway/config file with this line:

However it is quite inconvenient and I tried adding these arguments to .local/share/applications/discord.desktop file, but it didn't work and it still launches using XWayland. I tried writing a basic script and adding it to the Exec line and it still didn't work, though I can run the script manually and it works as it should. So, I gave up after a while.

 Also, I am using 150% scaling on my laptop and I need native Wayland to fix blurriness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although it’s pushed well past the 30-year mark since its release, Python remains one of the most relevant high-level programming languages in existence. Many developers will opt to use this language to make applications that can easily be maintained and require minimal hand-holding to work in a number of operating systems and distributions of Linux.
    
One of the greatest benefits of Python is its ability to snake (pun completely intended) around a lot of conventions found in other languages with little effort on behalf of the programmer, letting you compose incredibly simple little “quips” to get the job done. Here are a few examples!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quando si parla delle batterie di smartphone, tablet, dispositivi indossabili, altoparlanti Bluetooth e altri prodotti tecnologici di dimensioni compatte si fa spesso riferimento al termine mAh.Il simbolo mAh sta per milliampereora ed è utilizzato per esprimere la capacità di carica di una batteria. Il milliampereora è un sottomultiplo dell'unità di misura della carica elettrica ampera-ora (Ah) e ne rappresenta la millesima parte.L'ampere, com'è noto, misura l'intensità della corrente elettrica: con il termine 1 mAh si fa riferimento a un milliampere erogato per 3600 secondi (1 ora).Una batteria da 3.000 mAh è un dispositivo che può mantenere in uscita una corrente pari appunto a 3.000 mA per un'ora.È importante notare che i mAh sono solo una misura della capacità: non determinano la velocità con cui il caricabatterie riesce a caricare la batteria del dispositivo. La carica batteria veloce varia da un caricatore all'altro a seconda di una serie di fattori tra cui anche il supporto per la ricarica rapida.Va detto inoltre che la carica assorbita dal dispositivo al quale la batteria è collegata solitamente varia (e molto) nel corso del tempo.]]></summary>

Everything looks good but now if I play a YouTube video I can't play an audio file in qmmp. I have to get out of YouTube now in order to release the audio for qmmp or vice versa.
 I didn't have to do that before so what am I missing or was there an update to something that changed this from being allowed?
 I've installed pipewire, pulseaudio, ffmpeg, and of course Firefox and qmmp. This is pretty much the core of my audio software installation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am still very much a noob even though I've been using arch for over a year now.
 My AMD GPU fan is ramping to full speed regardless of temperature and I dont know why. Manual and automatic control result in the same behavior (I've manually set). I've tried using pwmconfig and setting it to manual mode with a user defined curve which it follows until it suddenly decides it wants to to go full speed. I've also tried using the fancontrol script (and fancontrol-gui) and it works until it doesn't, there doesn't seem to be any reason for the fan speed to ignore fancontrol. I thought it was a issue with zero RPM mode so I made a config that doesnt turn the fans off, that hasn't worked either. The card is often at "low" temperatures (sub 50 c) when it ramps. I can still stop the fans with pwmconfig, but I dont want to keep them stopped. 
 I've tried searching for someone with the same issue, all I get are guides on configuring fanspeed of pwm-capable fans, I am lost.
 I dont know what else about my system I need to provide, I am currently using the LTS kernel 5.15.48-1-lts
 Here is my current fancontrol config, though it has the same behavior without it.

Modificare le app predefinite in Windows 11
 Come nelle precedenti versioni di Windows, il modo migliore per cambiare l'associazione tra un programma e una specifica tipologia di file consiste nel fare clic con il tasto destro del mouse sul file, selezionare Proprietà quindi cliccare sul pulsante Cambia.

 logs
 So I recently have some serious issues with Davinci Resolve. I am using AMD Renoir with the proprietary OpenCL driver (opencl-amd) with the open source OpenGL driver. Sometimes it crashes. When it doesn't crash it messes up my video every single time as shown in the image. The log above is when it messes up my video. And here is the logs when it crashes (it seems to be the same log4cxx problem every time when it crashes).
 Please avoid comments like "use kdenlive instead".

Given I usually need to use windows for some programs for university, and seeing as to they don't run well in wine or a vm I kind of have to keep it. For the purpose of sharing files between the two OS's I have my big data disk formatted for NTFS. I have NTFS-3g installed and up until recently there were no issues. Recently however I haven't been able to write to that disk. I tried changing the fstab parameters, chown, chmod, and none of them fixed the issue. I also tested with an external drive, and I am able to write to that one. Has anyone encountered a similar issue and has anyone fixed it?
 Edit: Thank you so much to everyone that replied! I hope this fixes it, I remember reading that somewhere but for some reason i completely forgot it could apply to my setup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Previously, I used KDE+i3-gaps (replacing Kwin), but with the recent move by KDE in 5.25 I'm moving to just i3-gaps. In so doing, I've found that my protonvpn-cli is no longer able to connect.
 In i3-gaps (no KDE), I:
  
use NetworkManager successfully (WiFi through nmtui)
 launch and use Kwallet successfully
 have started launching gnome-keyring-daemon (confirmed running) according to https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GNOME/Keyring#Using_the_keyring
  
For clarity, I am using the official ProtonVPN client (protonvpn-cli via AUR).
 The NetworkManager <warn> I am running into is as follows:
  
failed to request VPN secrets #3: No agents were available for this request
  
​
 ProtonVPN is using OpenVPN. It worked perfectly fine with KDE+i3-gaps, so this is clearly a config issue on my part. I've run into issues with it accessing connection/OpenVPN specific credentials before, which I believe is why I had to install gnome-keyring alongside Kwallet, as I'd rather have just used Kwallet. I could be misremembering, though, and unlike those times before this is stumping me pretty hard.
 I have also installed the networkmanager-openvpn package, which didn't seem to do anything (not surprised as it wasn't installed when I was using KDE).
 If anyone could give me a nudge in the right direction, that would be very appreciated!
 ​
 Resources I've checked so far (though I could be blind):
  
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NetworkManager#VPN_support
 https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GNOME/Keyring#--start_step
 https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/ProtonVPN#Official_ProtonVPN_Client
 https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/OpenVPN#Troubleshooting_2
 https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/I3#Troubleshooting
 https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Desktop_environment#Custom_environments
  
​
 Solution (per UKnowMario): Install network-manager-applet and run nm-applet prior to ProtonVPN. Going to set nm-applet to run at startup in my i3 config.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was looking in to what's taking so much space in my root directory and noticed a few things, among them was several directories in /var/lib for packages that I uninstalled a very long time ago. As an example, one is /var/lib/postgres. I uninstalled postgresql and all of its dependencies nearly a year ago.
 I did run sudo pacman -Qo /var/lib/postgres and it returned error: No package owns /var/lib/postgres. Additionally sudo pacman -Q | grep postgres returns nothing, and searching postgres in PacFinder shows that I don't have postgres or any of its dependencies installed.
 So is it safe to just rm -rf /var/lib/postgres or is there a specific way I should be dealing with this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently installed Arch, but I noticed that I was unable to see any wireless access points with iwctl. Someone suggested that I may need linux-firmware, so I used my installation medium and arch-chroot to grab it. I also did a pacman -Syu. Now, when I try to boot into the OS after decrypting my partition, I see [FAILED] Failed to start Load Kernel Modules. and several instances of [FAILED] Failed to start Wireless services. before proceeding to the login screen. I can still login, but when I tried to launch iwctl, I got stuck on "waiting for IWD to respond," so clearly I broke something.
 I did some googling, and it seems that this can be caused by an unmounted /boot, but if I am understanding the output of lsblk -f correctly, then mine is mounted. I could also see /boot in my fstab (I should maybe mention, however, that it is on a different partition).
 My googling also revealed that not having mounted boot while in chroot and then updating the system may have caused the issue. I tried reinstalling linux after making sure to mount boot while in chroot but that didn't help. I also tried running mkinitcpio -p linux in arch-chroot, but that didn't help either unfortunately.
 Any idea what I can try next?

Today after an upgrade I tried to launch plasma and it hung for a few seconds then crashed. A quick look at recently installed packages led me to the line upgraded qt5-base (5.15.4+kde+r168-1.1 -> 5.15.5+kde+r162-1.1). Downloading and installing qt5-base-5.15.4+kde+r168-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst got plasma working again. Hope this helps people.

I liked the Pop!_Os switch between integrated and dedicated GPU, so searching I got https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hybrid_graphics and I installed the System76_power using paru and ran sudo system76-power graphics nvidia, it told me to reboot and I did and then my laptop boots but the screen doesn't turn on or renders anything for login screen(SDDM) where I input my password, I know my laptop is working because I can type my password and login, the splash screen appears, with no spinning animation and I am thrown into desktop with a black screen. Pressed ctrl+alt+tab and ran the command sudo system76-power graphics integrated, and then waiting a little while and rebooted and the screen work. Is there something I can do about this?
 Thanks for any help in advance.
