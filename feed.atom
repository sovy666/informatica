 I have noticed a very annoying behaviour in Gmail on my home machine based on arch, xfce and chromium. (It does not happen at work with Windows/Chrome).
 The gmail main window screen is always somehow using the entire screenwidth even though there are other widgets using the width. Consequently i have to slide the screen left and right to access the reply icon. This is completely stupid!

 I understand it may be unrelated to arch - in which case apologies for polluting this thread.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does your Windows PC or laptop fail to connect to the Internet even though other devices connect on the same network? This usually is preceded by an error message such as “A network cable is unplugged,” “Ethernet not working” or “Ethernet not connected.” Instead of the Internet icon displaying connectivity, you only see the offline “X” symbol which doesn’t go away on its own. 
    
There can be many possible causes for the network cable unplugged error, both software and hardware dependent. We bring you a systematic guide to troubleshoot the problem, and get back online quickly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[anyone here could help me with pipewire?
 i have an audio interface, which i used to pipe my usb mic to, so i could adjust its volume/mute it. it worked great with pulseaudio, and it works like this: this interface, generates a sink and a source. i piped my mic to the sink(alsa_output.usb-ZhuHai_JieLi_Technology_JieLi_BR17_20160823-01.analog-stereo) , then, its source (alsa_input.usb-ZhuHai_JieLi_Technology_JieLi_BR17_20160823-01.analog-stereo)to discord. that way, it worked perfectly, it showed the green led when it clipped, i could mute it, change its volume etc. 
 now, with pipewire, it seems that the alsa_input device is not connected to alsa_output device, so it does not work. the device seems to be receiving the audio though, as if i connect my headphones to the interface headphone port, i can hear my mic. i can adjust its volume as well, but the green light does not light up when the audio clips, and the sound does not go to the xxxx_input device.
 that's the interface. i was using the knob on top of the pc symbol to adjust the volume, and the mute under monitor knob to mute it. https://imgur.com/Wu6CN2b

 Internet works in other devices, I tried rebooting, reverting the changes to gdm (even if they shouldn't impact the internet) , restarting the router, tried connecting to other networks, logging in as root and even restoring a timeshift btrfs snapshot from the previous day. No luck
 And I am indeed connected to the network, I can access the router config page and my NAS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I apologize if this is off-topic, but it seems to abide by the rules. I'm a CS student who will use arch since I have an Asus laptop that doesn't play nicely with other distros. I'm not an overly security-conscious person but I'm wondering how my arch installation would compare to more common OS like Windows or Mac. I'm using a non privledged user with sudo and have apparmor and firejail enabled, but only with the default profiles. I'm not quite knowledgeable enough to create my own profiles. I also use ufw with the basic ruleset described in the arch wiki. I did some other steps on the arch wiki security page but I didn't want to go too far down the rabbit hole and do anything I don't understand. I've also heard mixed opinions on both apparmor and firejail. Alongside common sense and an adblocker, is this enough basic security? I realize this is largely opinion-based but it's not like I have extremely valuable information on my laptop.

I installed Sonarr with Yay and edited the user and group in /usr/lib/systemd/system/sonarr.service as well as chowned the user and group of /var/lib/sonarr. I also tried adding sonarr to the users group and mounting the NAS as that, still no luck. I uninstalled and reinstalled manually, using makepkg. After building I edited sonarr.service, sonarr.sysusers, and sonar.tmpfiles to change the user and group, then installed. Sonarr still installed with the user and group sonarr. Editing sonarr.service once again prevented Sonarr from running. I'm really at a loss as to what to do. I was able to add to my Sonarr library when I mounted my NAS as sonarr:sonarr, but that's not really a solution.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Il dispositivo dell'utente è a sua volta collegato con una o più carte di debito o di credito attraverso un portafoglio virtuale.Con il sistema attuale Apple non permette a terzi di elaborare pagamenti attraverso il sistema Pay dicendo che diversamente verrebbero meno la sicurezza e la privacy degli utenti.Al termine dell'indagine preliminare, la Commissione spiega di aver contestato ad Apple la sua decisione di impedire agli sviluppatori di app di accedere all'hardware e al software necessari (utilizzo del chip NFC integrato) a vantaggio della sua soluzione per la gestione dei pagamenti, Apple Pay appunto.'Abbiamo rilevato in via preliminare che Apple potrebbe aver limitato la concorrenza a vantaggio della sua soluzione Apple Pay.]]></summary>

I risultati ai quali pervengono AMD e NVidia sono però spesso diversi a causa delle particolarità che contraddistinguono le due tecnologie: ne abbiamo parlato nell'articolo in cui spieghiamo come scegliere monitor per PC.La certificazione AdaptiveSync di VESA offre una 'copertura' completa prendendo in considerazione sia le valutazioni di AMD che di NVidia sia una serie di aspetti addizionali.

La certificazione VESA è 'aperta' offrendo i risultati di 50 differenti test ai quali sono sottoposti i monitori AdaptiveSync: i vari giudizi includono prove tecniche e visive come flickering, frame drop, jitter, tempi di risposta dei pixel (grey to grey o GaG), ghosting, reverse ghosting e altro ancora.Per essere certificati AdaptiveSync i monitor devono supportare una frequenza di refresh minima pari ad almeno 60 Hz spingendosi fino a 144 Hz.Nel caso della certificazione MediaSync bastano un minimo di 48 Hz e un massimo di almeno 60 Hz: questa 'forbice' è ideale per gestire nella maniera più adeguata la resa di qualunque genere di contenuto multimediale.Anche nel caso di MediaSync lo sfarfallio deve essere assente, sono previsti gli stessi requisiti per evitare il ghosting di AdaptiveSync mentre il jitter deve essere pari a ±0,5 ms per una corretta riproduzione su PC di contenuti multimediali che sono tipicamente registrati a 23,976 Hz (valore che VESA stessa indica come uno 'standard' di fatto per gli studios di Hollywood)..]]></summary>

I followed that guide https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/power/basic-pm-debugging.html iterating the different test modes for /sys/Power/pm_test. As it seems, hibernation freezes due to a device driver, so I need to disable a half of my drivers? That would even mean I can't boot my system up, I think. Couldn't we narrow the set of possible drivers? I mean, aren't only drivers interesting supporting S4 modes, I don't know. I see a list of devices in /proc/acpi/wakeup, but I can't disable them by writing echo $device > /proc/acpi/wakeup or did I have to disable drivers over rmmod/unloading drivers at boot time?

Setting Up the yeedi vac MAX
    
Everything was packed inside the box for the yeedi vac MAX Robot Vacuum as expected. One notable difference from other vacuums is the lack of spare brushes and filters. Every other vacuum I’ve reviewed has had extra brushes and filters.

 I do have the Korean locale and a font installed. What should I do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been having this super annoying issue after gnome 42(I think). I'm using firefox with "MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1".
 If I open firefox on my monitor with laptop connected(only monitor screen in on), then I disconnect HDMI and switch to laptop screen, firefox can't open new windows(can't Ctr-N, can't "move to new windows"). And if I close the one active window firefox process does not die and I need to kill it myself, so I'm assuming firefox itself thinks it's running a window. After "killall firefox" if I open it again it's working fine.
 If I force firefox to use xwayland with MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=0 issue does not persist.
 I created new user and tested in there, tried old versions of firefox which I for sure remmember did not have this problem but they are broken as well. This is why I'm assuming it's a gnome 42 problem.
 Only thing firefox prints is bunch of these messages:
 khokho-PC firefox-developer-edition.desktop[17498]: Unsupported modifier, resource creation failed. khokho-PC firefox-developer-edition.desktop[17498]: XXX: resource creation failed 
 Monitor is 4k and laptop is 1080p if it has any relevance. Just changing resolution/dpi on one screen does not reproduce the issue...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Per WhatsApp, un'applicazione che ha storicamente basato l'autenticazione sull'utilizzo di un numero di telefono, già l'introduzione del supporto multidispositivo è stata un'innovazione non da poco.Con WhatsApp multidispositivo si può usare l'app anche senza smartphone su un numero massimo di 4 device aggiuntivi. È sufficiente toccare i quattro pallini in alto a destra sullo smartphone ovvero avviando sul dispositivo principale dove risulta installato WhatsApp: premendo Dispositivi collegati si può attivare la modalità multidispositivo che abilita l'utilizzo dell'app di messaggistica anche quando il telefono fosse spento, in modalità aereo o fuori copertura (WiFi e rete dati dell'operatore di telefonia mobile).Gli sviluppatori di WhatsApp stanno lavorando per abbattere anche l'ultimo muro rimasto: a breve l'applicazione potrà essere installata su un secondo smartphone oppure su un tablet e utilizzata in maniera del tutto indipendente rispetto al device principale.Anche se al momento non si conosce la data di rilascio della nuova funzionalità, l'attesa non dovrebbe essere lunga perché la presenza dell''inedita' caratteristica è stata avvistata da WABetaInfo in una delle più recenti versioni di anteprima di WhatsApp.Non sappiamo ancora come sarà tradotta in italiano ma toccando Register device as companion sarà possibile aggiungere un secondo smartphone o tablet.La configurazione sembra simile a quella che adesso permette l''accoppiamento' di nuovi dispositivi scegliendo Dispositivi collegati: bisognerà inquadrare il codice QR mostrato sul display dell'altro telefono e autorizzare l'operazione.]]></summary>

I have a sleep usb script that stops my lightspeed usb connector from >waking my pc from sleep. . . It has worked flawlessly on multiple >linux distros.
  
 Early in this build i tried light DM and removed it (2-3 months ago) Any tips to point me in the right direction would be awesome.

Selezionata la rete WiFi pubblica sul proprio dispositivo, la connessione non avviene
 Se ci si collega alla rete WiFi pubblica da un sistema Windows e l'icona in basso a destra visualizza il messaggio Connessione limitata, è bene premere la combinazione di tasti Windows+R, digitare ncpa.cpl, fare clic con il tasto destro sull'interfaccia di rete wireless, scegliere Proprietà, Protocollo Internet versione 4 (TCP/IPv4), cliccare ancora su Proprietà quindi scegliere le opzioni Ottieni automaticamente un indirizzo IP e Ottieni indirizzo server DNS automaticamente.In Windows suggeriamo comunque di digitare, al prompt dei comandi:ipconfig /releaseipconfig /renewSui dispositivi mobili bisogna accedere alla sezione WiFi e controllare di non aver impostato - nelle proprietà della connessione - un indirizzo IP privato statico.]]></summary>

 I suspect I'll need to rebuild it each time the kernel is upgraded in the AUR, if I want to stay current.
 If I build the package and install; will it take care of updating Grub menu entries?
 Is there anything I should be aware of in terms of caution? Aside from running backups prior to installing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9 with an encrypted LUKS2 root partition with FIDO2 authentication. It is a dual boot setup with Windows 11, where systemd will chainload an EFIstub.
 I want to protect against Evil Maid attacks and want to sign systemd-boot and my EFIstub with keys that will then be enrolled in Secure Boot.
 The best way to do this seems to be to use /u/Foxboron's sbctl utility, but I'm worried about doing so because ThinkPad X1 Carbon models have had a propensity to brick when secure boot keys have been enrolled improperly: https://old.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/epadb5/psa_dont_install_custom_secure_boot_keys_on_x1/
 I'm not sure if the issue has been fixed between Gen7 and Gen9, but my Gen9 does require OpRom in the boot chain. I'm not sure what the right steps to take to properly enroll self signing in UEFI with such hardware is.
 Could anyone confirm they've successfully done this process on an X1 Carbon Gen 9 using sbctl and that has not resulted in a brick of the laptop? If so, could you point me to some steps on how to do that?
 Thanks in advance.

 ​
 This came to attention when I recently tried to install imagemagick. 
 I get an error - imagemagick-7.1.0.28-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst failed to download
 I imagine that I need to upgrade my mirrors or synchronize my package database, but either way having to do `pacman -Syu would upgrade all my packages. What should I be doing instead?

I noticed that a few other people have had this issue these past few days on this subreddit, but even after trying all of the fixes people reccomended in those threads I'm unable to fix the issue.
 So far I've tried deleting all files in /var/lib/pacman/sync, clearing the cache completely with 'paccache -rk 0', running 'pacman -Syy' then 'pacman -S archlinux-keyring', to no avail.
 Any ideas on what more I could do to fix this issue? Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm not able to boot into KDE, I can only move between TTY2-6 with CTRL+ALT+F*. 
 I have both the default and hardened kernels installed, the issue is the same on both, but on the hardened session I have an error message reading
 "libbpf: failed to find valid kernel BTF libbpf: Error loading vmlinux BTF: -3 libbpf: failed to load object 'iterators_bpf' libbpf: failed to load BPF skeleton 'iterators_bpf': -3 Failed load could be due to wrong endianness"
 I have tried searching for fixes related to this message, unable to find anything relevant to what I'm experiencing.
 This issue started after I installed steam, so I had run a partial upgrade by accident to add the multilib packages, then ran a full upgrade. Here I decided to shut the system down to install two other SSD's I used for storing games on my old rig. 
 Powered everything up, grub was fine, and the error I mentioned earlier shows up during the journal recovery screen before KDE loads.
 So far, with my TTY, I have tried reinstalling KDE and trying various methods of getting a gui session, like Ctrl+Alt+F7, and systemctl commands to start/restart kde's services.
 I have tried the loginctl command, which only returns my current TTY session, or any others that happen to be open.
 I should mention that I used the archinstall script during installation, but I can't imagine that would affect anything. If there's anything else I should provide I'll do my best to add it.
 I am somewhat new to troubleshooting Arch, so I'm certain there's something I'm overlooking. Any help or ideas is much appreciated, thanks.

I have both my input and output devices set up in ALSA with seemingly no issue (have tested with arecord and aplay), and I have JACK and qjackctl installed. JACK seems to be set up to use ALSA as the driver and everything is set to default, but none of the DAWs I've tried seem to be able to record any audio when I have them set up to connect to JACK (I've tried both Ardour and Reaper).
 My speakers are connected through a Schiit Modi 2 and my microphone is through a Zoom H4n, if that information helps.
 Happy to provide any other information, and thanks in advance for any help you can offer!

I'm just running discord via /usr/bin/discord which I believe uses XWayland (since it's using the bundled electron rather than system electron and swaymsg -t get_tree shows a null app_id). Whenever I receive a new discord message, I see the appropriate mako notification. However, when I click on the notification, discord crashes with the following:
 ``` ../../third_party/tcmalloc/chromium/src/free_list.cc:135] Memory corruption detected.
 Failed to get crash dump id. Report Id: 39eabcfe-e434-40 zsh: segmentation fault (core dumped) discord ```
 Everything is up to date on my system, so not sure what's causing this. It's the only app that I've experienced this so far.
 A bit more info about the system:
  
extra/wayland 1.20.0-2
 extra/xorg-xwayland 22.1.1-1 (xorg)
 community/sway 1:1.7-2
 community/mako 1.6-3
 community/wlroots 0.15.1-3
 Linux LTS: 5.15.36-1
 Intel i7-8650U CPU @ 1.90GHz
 Intel Corporation UHD Graphics 620
 16GB Ram
  
Any thoughts about what could be causing this and how to go about fixing it? The arch wiki troubleshooting section doesn't mention anything about this specific issue, so that's why I'm asking here.

 I have been trying to understand why the binaries of duckstation-git are not working as intended, given that when I manually build it using the instructions on the project's Git Hub, it worked flawlessly.
 i came to realize that it was due to the "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release" flag. But as the CMake package guidelines on the Wiki says, it produces undesired behavior on PKGBUILDs, as it uses the -O3 compiler optimization flag, while the default default Arch Linux flag which currently is -O2.
 Building the PKGBUILD with "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=None" as the Wiki suggests makes the binaries doesn't work at all.
 Does anyone know if there is any cmake flag or build option to make it work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The answer is YES and you know why? because SDL 1.2 development ended long ago, with SDL 2.0 replacing it. However, many older games still use SDL 1.2 and cannot change to SDL 2.0. In order to help move SDL 1.2 games into the modern world, so SDL 1.2 is replaced with sdl12-compat, which uses SDL 2.0.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I’ve been setting up my compositor picom-jonaburg. I have noticed this weird visual issue. It’s as though it’s in limbo between both lines and wants to represent them both. Here’s an example: https://imgur.com/a/cxTLwj0
 As of now, it’s only present in urxvt/vim. It doesn’t occur at the start of the file. It’s also not occurring symmetrically. In an 89 line file, it only starts at line 47 consistently. If I put my cursor on line 46 it stops, back to 47 it continues. This pattern of movement doesn’t stop it from happening from lines 47 to the bottom.
 Any ideas of where to start looking? Picom? Xresources ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google Maps is popular and robust enough to have more or less brought on the death of the paper map, and with features like a speed limit checker it feels like it’s getting more and more accessible by the day. But there are still reasons why you wouldn’t want to, or can’t, use Google Maps. Some countries, like China, run a pretty tight ship when it comes to regulation, making Google Maps as good as useless. 
    
Or maybe you just don’t want Google algorithms profiting off your data. Whatever your reasons, we won’t pry and instead treat you to the best Google maps alternatives that work similarly well as Google Maps.
