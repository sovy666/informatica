 I'm trying to solve this problem since a while but i cannot seem able to find any documentation regarding this.
 When i set up mirror monitor in gnome settings, it goes on an sub optimal frequency and my main monitor flickers.
 If i set up with xrandr it's perfect.
 I don't know how to make this change permanent.
 i would like to:
 A) find the right xsettings ovverride command in dconf to do this
 B) run the xrandr command on gnome startup (i tried but gnome seems to load its settings after my command, reverting it back)
 C) i'm opened to other solutions you can come up with!
 xrandr --output DVI-I-1 --auto --output HDMI-0 --auto 
 gives this
 Screen 0: minimum 8 x 8, current 1920 x 1080, maximum 16384 x 16384 DVI-I-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) D…]]></summary>

When I test the mic on mic-testing websites and I hear the recording, everything is well, but they still say the mic doesn't work. And it's the same thing when I test it on Discord, I hear the playback, but the mic isn't recognized. I've looked everywhere at this point, tried everything. When I input "pulseaudio" into the terminal, this is what I get back:
 E: [pulseaudio] pid.c: Daemon already running.
 E: [pulseaudio] main.c: pa_pid_file_create() failed.
 I've looked into Pavucontrol, and have played with the settings and tried everything on there, still the same problem.
 Also when I'm screensharing on Discord, there is no audio input or output in the stream.
 Any help is appreciated!

 I've recently installed Arch Linux on my UEFI system [NO DUAL BOOT]. I'd followed the exact same steps as mentioned in the Arch wiki installation page. Before proceeding with the installation, I had disabled the Secure Boot option from BIOS and after successful installation when I try to enable the Secure Boot option, the Arch Linux fails to boot.
 So, I'm trying to add Secure Boot to my Arch Linux installation using Shim-signed. From what I read on the Arch Wiki is that we need to have a .Sbat Section, or the EFI binaries won't load. But I couldn't get how to create one. Even after reading through this ReadME: https://github.com/rhboot/shim/blob/main/SBAT.md
 ​
 Please guide me on how to create a .sbat for shim-signed so that I can enable the Secure Boot.
 Please note: I have only Arch Linux installed on my system [NO DUAL BOOT].
 OS: Arch Linux x86_64
 Kernel: 5.15.32-1-lts [Linux-lts]
 Desktop Environment: GNOME 42.0

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I did my Arch install a long time ago using Gnome and Xorg I'm trying to switch to wayland. Would this still be the proper way of switching or is this method outdated?
 First, you need to enable NVIDIA kernel modesetting, to do this add the kernel parameter nvidia-drm.modeset=1. Next, ensure that GDM wayland isn't disabled (this isn't strictly necessary since you can launch GNOME from command line). Go to /etc/gdm/custom.conf, and comment out the waylandenable=false line if it is present. Next, you need to edit a udev rule. Edit /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/61-gdm.rules (location might vary based on distro, however its usually there). And comment out the line that mentions disabling wayland if NVIDIA proprietary driver is present. Reboot, you should now be able to use GNOME on Wayland on proprietary NVIDIA driver. And note again that you won't have Xwayland acceleration or it won't work at all, and that there are some NVIDIA eglstreams specific bugs, and that certian functions might have reduced performance compared to GBM.

 In settings or Extensions every time i need to press another button, like settings or add applications or keyboard shortcuts always happens 2 things, or the words disappear or the window becomes slightly darker and locks. If i press ESC it returns to normal but i can never go that extra step.

Preset scenes on the SwitchBot LED Strip Light make it really easy to use on those days when you just can’t decide on a color scheme. Set custom colors as well from 1600W colors and five color modes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Manual vacuuming is becoming a thing of the past thanks to robot vacuums. The ILIFE A11 LiDAR Robot Vacuum wants you to be able to relax, travel, or just go about your day without having to think about this dreaded chore ever again. As both a vacuum and mop, it’s designed to handle all the dirty work so that you don’t have to. I recently had the opportunity to test out this robot vac.

Overview of Features
    
The ILIFE A11 LiDAR Robot Vacuum is a new release from ILIFE and features the latest LiDAR 2.0 technology. This is designed to boost mapping efficiency by 50 percent, thanks to a sampling rate of 3,000 samples per second and measurement areas of 26 feet.
    
The vacuum uses a CV-Slam algorithm to create more efficient and neat mapping patterns. This also helps to better clean along edges and corners that some vacuums... Read more]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just updated to GNOME 42 and oh my god my system wasn't this broken since a long time.
 Basically everything is worse. The desktop stutters like hell when external monitor is connected to my laptop. Animations aren't as smooth as they used to be. Dark/light mode feature only changes wallpapers and nothing else. Settings app gets bigger each time it's launched and it frequently crashes.
 I think I will discover many more bugs unless I just revert my system to GNOME 41.
 Is anyone's experience similar to mine? I use Xorg so maybe that's the issue but Wayland isn't really an option for me because of lack of support for reverse prime. Also if Xorg causes problems with new GNOME version then why support it in the first place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intel ha annunciato di aver tagliato un importante traguardo presso il suo stabilimento irlandese (Fab 34): la litografia ultravioletta estrema (EUV) è un processo costruttivo che permette di produrre, a partire dai wafer in silicio, chip sempre più miniaturizzati.Gli scanner litografici rappresentano la parte del processo produttivo che porta a realizzare un processore: stampano la microarchitettura di ogni singolo chip su un wafer di silicio scannerizzando un modello e trasferendone l'immagine sul wafer stesso che viene poi sviluppato. Sebbene gli scanner litografici facciano parte del processo produttivo dei chip da diversi anni, la più recente versione della tecnologia, EUV, consente di stampare i circuiti in dimensioni più ridotte e con una maggiore precisione.Azienda leader nella produzione di macchinari per l'utilizzo della soluzione EUV è l'olandese ASML, spesso tirata in ballo anche di recente quando si è parlato di Chips Act e degli sforzi europei per spostare una buona parte della produzione di chip nel vecchio continente entro il 2030.

Lo specifico sistema EUV prodotto da ASML e installato presso l'impianto Fab 34 di Intel in Irlanda è probabilmente il più complesso macchinario mai costruito: è composto da 100.000 parti, 3.000 cavi, 40.000 bulloni e più di un chilometro e mezzo di tubi.]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-04-07T14:24:22.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ello peeps, I've made a custom personal arch repo a while back and it's serving me great, feel free to reuse it to build your own.
 My usage is:
  
place PKGBUILD files in pkgfiles
 execute repo_manager script which: 
 builds all of them to .tar.zst packages
 registers those in a repo database file all of which are located in repo/x86_64
 
  
I'm aiming to improve a couple things:
  
aur-like support I want to have the ability to simply put a PKGBUILD file in an aur folder and have my aur helper (I use paru) fetch and build it locally
 making repo_manager a bit smarter
  
the relevant functions are
 build_pkgbuild() { MAKEPKG_FLAGS=${1:-'-scC'} makepkg $MAKEPKG_FLAGS JUNK_FILES=`ls | grep -v 'PKGBUILD'` rm -rf $JUNK_FILES } build_all_pkgs() { for pkg in `ls $REPO_ROOT/pkgfiles`; do echo "building $pkg" cd "$REPO_ROOT/pkgfiles/$pkg" build_pkgbuild done } 
 now build_all_pkgs works fine but slow, it tries to build each PKGBUILD and skips with an error once it realizes that it's already up to date (according to pkgver and pkgrel within the PKGBUILD itself)
 as you can see each error takes about a second which is painful with many packages
 I'm hoping to have build_outdated_pkgs which should build only the PKGBUILDS that actually need building.
 I assume that I should query the database files (personal.db & personal.files) but idk how, seriously what are even those files, they sure aren't sqlite.

Google explained that it collaborates with developers to work with newer Android OS versions and does so to “maintain the trusted experience people expect on Google Play.”

Talvolta, soprattutto quando non ci si accorge che la stampante è offline, tendono a formarsi importanti code di stampa sulle varie workstation.In alcuni casi risulta necessario eliminare la coda di stampa perché i documenti che si desiderano stampare restano perennemente in attesa di essere presi in carico.Cancellare la coda di stampa bloccata è utile sia per chi utilizza una stampante locale, collegata al PC in uso, sia chi fa uso di una stampante di rete connessa al router via cavo Ethernet o WiFi. Talvolta la stampante può essere condivisa da altri PC usando le funzioni integrate in Windows, macOS e Linux oppure mediante l'utilizzo di un print server. Alcuni router dotati di porte USB integrano tale funzionalità.Quando la stampante non stampa è bene prendere in esame tutte le possibile problematiche che possono impedire il corretto invio di documenti alla stampante.Per eliminare la coda di stampa e sbloccare la stampante è necessario intervenire sullo spooler di stampa: si tratta di un componente software che agisce come una memoria buffer per i dati diretti alla stampante.]]></summary>

Come configurare e usare la tastiera Google
 Usare la tastiera Google con il proprio dispositivo Android è molto semplice: basta accedere alle impostazioni del sistema operativo, selezionare Lingua e immissione o Lingua e tastiera quindi optare per Gboard in corrispondenza di Tastiera corrente.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twitch is a live streaming service that primarily serves the gaming community. It’s a well-known platform for eSports competition organizers, eSports professionals, content creators, and casual gamers who like sharing their gaming sessions with an audience. Similar services are YouTube Gaming and Facebook Live.
    
However, Twitch isn’t only for gamers. The service also houses non-gaming content creators such as Kitboga, The8BitDrummer, and other content creators from different non-gaming categories.
    
How to Use Twitch Keyboard Shortcuts
    
As a content creator on Twitch, there are no set Twitch keyboard shortcuts you can use. This is because broadcasting software such as OBS Studio has integrated the basic needs of a Twitch streamer into its user interface, so you won’t be clicking much or pressing buttons on Twitch when you’re streaming.
    
For content viewers, however, there are several Twitch keyboard shortcuts that are ready to be used. If you frequent your favorite Twitch streamer’s content, you should know how to pause, play, rewind, and clip moments with quick keystrokes for a smooth viewing experience.
    
Here are the essential Twitch keyboard shortcuts for watching videos, live... Read more]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use a bluetooth keyboard that I believe to be a Nulea (it is unbranded from AliExpress). Works beautifully, and it very responsive, in general very happy).
 The issue is that in any program where keyboard shortcuts are defined, MOD+CONTROL+{h,j,k,l} doesn't work. Every other combination is fine (MOD+vimkeys, MOD+SHIFT+imkeys, ALT+imkeys, etc). The only combination that doesn't work (and I have tried this in various WMs, vim, sxhkd, etc) is MOD+CONTROL+imkeys.
 When I run xev, those particular keychords are not even recognized. (MOD down and up, good. MOD down + CONTROL down, good. etc. But MOD + CONTROL + {h,j,k,l} show nothing)
 This makes me think that maybe something is running that hold those particular chords in its config? But I have no idea what that could be. I have a pretty minimal Arch running (fewer than 1000 packages installed) as I run most of my development tools in docker containers.
 If someone can offer at least a direction to look, I would really appreciate it.

I used airblader’s i3-gaps wm (I’m looking to switch to bspwm for arch linux) and used polybar for a taskbar. I don’t think I have any need for a desktop environment, since I don’t need a “bundle” of stuff if I can somehow assemble all the individual parts I need together. 
 Are there alternatives to a desktop environment? I’m not sure exactly how I can get a gui to work without one. What other parts do I need? Guides seem scarce as it seems most people just install Gnome. 
 This is new ground for me. Sorry if I sound like a noob right now. Any help would be appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everything was working fine until I decided to try to play the original Colonization game on steam. When i tried to run it my monitors went black with an "out of range" message on it and it persists after rebooting. The SDDM animation displays as normal on boot but then when I'd normally get to the KDE desktop i get the black screens again. I was able to hear Firefox start playing a video due to random luck pressing buttons during the black screen, so i'm sure its running I think its just stuck in a display setting that isn't working.
 I've tried editing the kernel parameters and adding nomodeset, also tried specifying the resolution and refresh rate of my monitor there and it doesn't help. I've tried unplugging and plugging the monitors, booting with just one monitor connected, none of it has made a difference. Any suggestions on how to get back to my desktop? I'm using systemdboot and X11 if that makes any difference. Thanks.
 Edit: Finally fixed it. Booted with the kernel parameter 3 in order to boot to the command line and deleted everything in ~/.local/share/kscreen
 Now working after a reboot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just learned that I need to configure hibernation and Suspend on My Laptop.
 Wondering if you could provide some tips or pointers?
 My goal is to read through the Wiki for both power management and Hybrid setup. I'm trying to determine ahead of time what tools I might need.
 I'm running the mainline, upstream kernel (5.17), with btrfs (Post 5.0), and KDE with Powerdevil installed. What other tools might I require? acpid? laptop-mode-tools? any Gui?
 Can I set this up with GUI only? 
 Is there anything to be aware of when configuring? 
 What tools do you recommend?
 My laptop is Asus FA506IU Ryzen 4800H and 1660ti.
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Creare una immagine fasulla di una persona, che sembra assolutamente reale, non richiede grandi sforzi o programmi particolari, basta fare qualche ricerca su Internet e ci sono vari siti, come This person does not exist.com che generano una immagine in pochi secondi. Queste immagini “AI generate” possono poi essere usate, per esempio, in un sito di incontri per spacciarsi per una persona reale di bell’aspetto e tentare qualche truffa. Mi è così capitato di provare l’estensione, disponibile solo per Chrome e i browser basati su Chromium, Fake Profile Detector, sviluppata da V7 Labs, che è in grado di riconoscere le immagini fasulle generate usando il metodo StyleGAN. Al momento non è in grado di riconoscere fotomontaggi o video fasulli. Per maggiori informazioni potete vedere una dimostrazione del funzionamento dell’estensione in un video, in inglese, di Alberto Rizzoli, uno dei fondatori di V7 Lab.

 I find when I try to explain what these files are, why its important to care, and why users are expected to promptly deal with them as part of routine system maintenance in an Arch based rolling distro, people's eyes glaze over (probably has something to do with my use of exciting terms like "routine system maintenance" 😉)
 Does anyone have a good resource or good elevator pitch length explanation of what they are and why its important for Arch users to care.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a known issue with the mt7921e driver that causes it to sometimes fail to load after a reboot/default shutdown command. The patch is live in the mainline kernel so I'd rather wait than recompile it myself, but for the time being I've been holding the power button down on my laptop to forcibly kill the power. Obviously this is less than ideal, so I was wondering what the safest way to perform this kind of power cycle is, short of removing the battery.

 The network admin recently blocked outgoing traffic on port 22. So I can't access Git repos through ssh. I couldn't get it to use Psiphon's localhost socks proxy.
 For Github I ended up following this guide to use the ssh.github.com:443 endpoint instead of github.com:22. https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/troubleshooting-ssh/using-ssh-over-the-https-port
 Is there something similar for AUR ssh? Are there any alternatives?
