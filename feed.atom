        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, for about a week or two I have noticed that things have randomly been crashing on my install for no apparent reason. Whether it be Firefox, Discord, games, or my entire system, things are just randomly crashing. I have looked through my system logs but have not had any luck finding anything. I do find the core dumps of programs that crashed, but with no hint to what caused it. Has anyone else been experiencing anything similar over the past few weeks, and if so have you found a solution?

Con i computer che hanno Windows 11 come sistema operativo, e Windows 10 con tutti gli aggiornamenti, l’uso di Internet Explorer 11 è stato proprio disabilitato e succede che Internet Explorer “sparisce” e si apre Edge al suo posto.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've wondering whether it's possible, and wise to redirect the output of pacman to a logfile or /dev/null. I want to create a script that send the least amount of information to the Screen, however, I'd like the information to be useful as well.
 I also want to avoid removing pacman prompts from the user's view.
 Is there a pacman option for a quieter less verbose mode? or could I do something like
 sudo pacman -Syu 2>&1 SomeLogFile.txt
 Why might that be a good or bad idea? Are there better alternatives?
 Thanks.
 EDIT:
 Thanks to u/lucasrizzini for providing some sane pacman and terminal commands for dealing with pacman's output. This is looking quite promising for a script usage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had this problem for a while now, and unfortunately I can't pinpoint when it started occuring. I do however know that it wasn't an issue until at most 6 months ago.
 When opening the lid of my laptop, the wireless connection is disabled and I have to manually enable it again. journalctl -f shows
 kernel: wlo1: deauthenticating from [MAC address] by local choice (Reason: 3=DEAUTH_LEAVING)
 right before Lid opened. When the lid is closed, the connection remains on as usual.
 The strangest thing is that this doesn't always happen. Upon reboots, it's possible that during that session this issue does not occur. However, if it does occur, it always occurs when opening the lid during that session.
 My laptop has an Intel 7265 wireless controller using the iwlwifi firmware. I use NetworkManager, and if it matters, its plasma-nm frontend for KDE Plasma. I've disabled MAC randomization using the method in the wiki.

 Now Arch won't boot and gives this error:
 Error device 'PARTUUID=xxx' not found. Skipping fsck.
 And I get dropped into rootfs. I'm guessing there is a simple way to fix this, I just have troubles finding it.
 My M.2 boot drive does show up in the BIOS btw.
 Edit: This 'BIOS reset' changed the SATA mode to RAID so arch couldn't find the proper drive. Just Dell things I guess ?

 After 20 secs like that I pressed the poweroff button and booted again, mounted the partition chrooted runed passwd and everything worked.
 Now my question is: Can I still run the system with the fact that I shuted down with my partitions mounted and passwd running without problems? Or should I reinstall?

 Had to go to /usr/bin/gwe and change 0.7 to 0.8 on Line 47 to fix it.
 Last night (16-07-2022), iirc. gwe had an update and this morning (17-07-2022) gwe is not launching again.
 Had the same error:
 Traceback (most recent call last): File "/usr/bin/gwe", line 47, in <module> gi.require_version('Notify', '0.8') File "/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/gi/__init__.py", line 129, in require_version raise ValueError('Namespace %s not available for version %s' % ValueError: Namespace Notify not available for version 0.8 
 So, I tried to go back to /usr/bin/gwe and changed 0.8 back to 0.7 and it worked again.
 Idk. what to do with this information, so just wanted to share it here in case you guys are having the same problem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okay so, I have attempted to install Arch Linux onto my Live USB via belena etcher, I downloaded directly from Https and I do have the ISO image and signature, however, when I attempt to flash it onto my USB drive, I am met with an error that reads:
 Command failed: cmd/c "C:Users/AppData/local/temp/etcher/balena etcher-electron-25b04127c174.cmd"
 Internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:890 Throw err; ^ Error: Cannot find module
 I also attempted to format my USB drive to delete previous data but it also displays an error and just says its not able to format it.
 I don't know what I've did, I simply followed the instructions, perhaps I chose the wrong mirror? It seems right to me, "archlinux...86_64.iso" and I'm almost 100% that my system supports 64 bit, its a 2006 Thinkpad T60 with Intel Core Duo 2. 
 Anyone have any solutions? Idk what I've did wrong here :(

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using paru and it seems like there's no reason to use pacman. Every time I want to install packages, search, view package files, update, etc. I always use paru because (as far as I can tell) it's basically just pacman but better, since it has AUR packages and I just need to type paru pckgname instead of sudo pacman -Syu pckgname
 Is there any reason to even use pacman if paru exists? Is there anything I'm unknowingly missing out on?
 EDIT: It seems I've created some confusion. I'm obviously not talking about deleting pacman, and I know paru is just a wrapper for it. I'm just talking about "replacing" it as in when I want to install or manage packages in the terminal, using the paru command instead of pacman.

 an example of my issue is when I install lutris, I am stuck having to install 6-7 python dependencies each and every-time, this started when I had issues with both python and pip during a system upgrade and had to delete their files and reinstall them so I could fix the issue and pacman would let me do do updates. I assume what happened is pacman assumes modules are still installed that are not installed is there any direct fix to this. 
 Thanks

 And for any one who will question me who did you installed windows 11 without UEFI and TPM I used Third Party tools to Skip any UEFI or TPM check 
 and Another Question 
 is Windows 11 is the real problem that make the bios did not recognize the Linux bootloader..
 and another thing I want to add before upgrading to Windows 11..I installed Arch Linux for trying only before taking the real step it was working and booting without any problems and it was at the same hard drive that I have problems with booting in Arch Linux Now

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The concept of using Linux on a touchscreen monitor or two-in-one computer has come a long way. Touchscreen support is now built in to the Linux kernel, so theoretically, any Linux distribution should be able to run with a touchscreen. That said, not every distribution will be easy to use on a touchscreen, and this comes down to the desktop environment each one works best with. You may have to choose the best Linux distros for a touchscreen that use the optimal desktop out of the box.
    
For example, using a tiling window manager like Awesome or i3 isn’t going to do you much good on a touchscreen without some heavy tweaking. Choose the right desktop environment, and you’ll have a much better time using Linux on this type of hardware.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been having the worst case of microphone noise. My recorded audio would include a consistent high-pitched static sound that I find best described as "whine" (kinda like coil whine). I suspect it's got something to do with my particular motherboard but I have no idea. Plugging in different mics in different places did nothing to help the issue and I would hear it the same with no mic plugged in.
 The solution is to use a package called noise-suppression-for-voice. It uses the same neural net technology as rnnoise which is used by OBS studio. My best results have been achieved by using this along with the echo cancel module. After installing the above package, you want to add the following lines to your default.pa config file (mine is in .config/pulse/default.pa):
 # Create echo cancel source # module-echo-cancel will automatically cancel from the current default source load-module module-echo-cancel source_name=echo_cancel_source # Create denoised mic device load-module module-null-sink sink_name=denoised_mic_sink rate=48000 sink_properties='device.description="Denoised Mic"' load-module module-ladspa-sink sink_name=mic_sink sink_master=denoised_mic_sink label=noise_suppressor_stereo plugin=/usr/lib/ladspa/librnnoise_ladspa.so control=50 sink_properties='device.description="Noise Suppressor"' load-module module-loopback source=echo_cancel_source sink=mic_sink channels=2 source_dont_move=true sink_dont_move=true latency_msec=1 # Set as default source set-default-source denoised_mic_sink.monitor

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I'm currently installing Arch in my PC and im running into a few problems. 
 First, when i try using pacstrap to download Linux Linux-Firmware and Base, it tells me that it failed to synchronize all databases (pgp signature). I tried fixing it by updating archlinux-keyring, but that doesn't work. Is there an easy fix for this? I searched half of the internet to find a solution, and nothing worked.
 Secondly, sometimes it doesn't have the problem with the pgp signature but rather not enough disk space. I mounted the root partition to /mnt and the EFI partition to /mnt/EFI. The root partition is 455 gib in size. My theory is, that it tries to download the packages to my install stick, which is only 16gib. How do I fix this?
 Thx in advance
 PS: I'm relatively new to Linux, so sorry if I don't use the right terminology

 - Packages that moved from AUR to official repository. Would pacman be able to automatically update the packages if this happens?
 - Configurations that's specific to certain software versions. For example the hardware acceleration under Firefox that's version and X11/Wayland dependent. Apart from checking Arch wiki from time to time, any better solutions out there?
 Thanks!
