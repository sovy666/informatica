        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many leading news websites nowadays come with paywalls. To read more than two or three articles on such websites, you have to pay for a subscription. If you need occasional access to a publication’s website, it doesn’t make sense to subscribe to all of them. Also, the limited free content available might not be enough to evaluate whether a subscription is worth paying for. In such cases, it helps to know how to bypass the news sites’ restrictive paywalls.

Why Do News Sites Have Paywalls?
1. Use Cached Versions of Websites
2. Clear All-time Browsing Data
3. Use Web Archives
4. Use Paywall Bypass Extensions
5. Switch Browsers/Devices and Use a VPN

 After the recent KDE plasma update i think 2 or three days ago, the KDE Menu aka Launcher and Kicker pannel is very slow. That means if i click it nothing happens for like 5-8 seconds. Then it behaves as it should a a click is a click etc. But very slow. However rest of the System and KDE Apps like dolphin work normal. Just the pannel and plasma menu are slow as hell.
 Composite effects are already off.
 Any ideas ?

 #!/bin/bash begin=$(date +%s%N) while true do if ping -q -w 1 -c 1 `ip r | grep default | cut -d ' ' -f 3` &> /dev/null ; then break else finaltime=$(($(date +%s%N) - begin)) fi done echo $((finaltime/1000000)) 
 This basically gives me the amount of time the system had no internet connection in milliseconds. I average around 15500 ms, so around 16s after wake, which I find annoying. I tried to fix this with a service in systemd, but restaring networkmanager or playing around with r8169 didn't work.
 Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

This device will replace your existing doorbell while recording footage of visitors and alerting you to people on your doorstep or motion in the area.
    
The Ring has two-way talk, advanced motion detection, customizable settings, and connects via 2.4 GHz. Real-time notifications will be sent directly to your phone. If you connect an Echo device, you can get notifications there as well. As the Ring won’t play your existing doorbell sound, connect a Chime to hear it or rely on hearing a doorbell sound through your phone or Echo device.
    

    
Advanced motion detection will alert you to someone on your doorstep before they hit the Ring Video Doorbell. Talk to them by turning on the mic in the app on your phone or by telling Alexa to “talk to the front door.” The camera has night... Read more]]></summary>

 After doing some searching online, I came across this answer on stackexchange
 Following is the script suggested by a user on this thread. The only problem being it seems to be a script for a gnome setup.
 #!/bin/bash # Cleanup any bad state we left behind if the user exited while flash was # running gconftool-2 -s /apps/gnome-screensaver/idle_activation_enabled --type bool true we_turned_it_off=0 while true; do sleep 60 flash_on=0 for pid in `pgrep firefox` ; do if grep libflashplayer /proc/$pid/maps > /dev/null ; then flash_on=1 fi ss_on=`gconftool-2 -g /apps/gnome-screensaver/idle_activation_enabled` if [ "$flash_on" = "1" ] && [ "$ss_on" = "true" ]; then gconftool-2 -s /apps/gnome-screensaver/idle_activation_enabled \ --type bool false we_turned_it_off=1 elif [ "$flash_on" = "0" ] && [ "$ss_on" = "false" ] \ && [ "$we_turned_it_off" = "1" ]; then gconftool-2 -s /apps/gnome-screensaver/idle_activation_enabled \ --type bool true we_turned_it_off=0 fi done done 
 Could I possibly have a xdg-screensaver equivalent written for my system? I know its probably possible but I am unable to wrap my head around it. Any help/guidance in the right direction is highly appreciated.
 To be clear, I am not looking for a manual solution like activating presentation mode from the terminal/using caffeine (which would only work if the apps are in full screen).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chi ha vissuto l'informatica negli anni '90 certamente si ricorderà degli storici processori Mendocino di Intel immessi sul mercato nel 1998. Erano CPU Celeron che risultavano interessanti per le buone opportunità offerte agli appassionati di overclocking.Adesso anche AMD sceglie il nome Mendocino (si ispira a quello di una contea californiana, negli Stati Uniti) e lo fa per le sue nuove APU destinate ai notebook più efficienti ed economici. La conferma arriva all'apertura dei battenti del Computex 2022 di Taipei.I nuovi AMD Ryzen Mendocino sembrano piuttosto simili all'APU personalizzata Aerith che la società di Sunnyvale ha sviluppato per la console portatile Steam Deck di Valve.Mendocino includerà CPU, GPU e controller di memoria nello stesso pacchetto e sarà prodotta da TSMC su un moderno processo produttivo a 6 nm.AMD ha scelto in questo caso di utilizzare l'architettura Zen 2 e non la più aggiornata Zen 3 per motivi di costi e consumi proponendo modelli con 4 core fisici e 8 thread.Punto nodale è sicuramente la sezione grafica: AMD l'ha migliorata rispetto alle precedenti APU con grafica integrata basata su architettura RDNA2.Mendocino supporterà inoltre memorie LPDDR5 nelle configurazioni con bus di memoria a due (64 bit) o ​​quattro canali (128 bit).Il resto delle sue funzionalità di I/O, connettività e ottimizzazione dell'alimentazione sono le stesse utilizzate nella serie Ryzen 6000.

In termini di durata della batteria, AMD assicura che i computer basati su chip Mendocino potranno essere utilizzati per almeno 10 ore prima di necessitare di una ricarica.I primi sistemi basati su Ryzen Mendocino arriveranno sul mercato prima di Natale e si sa già che a utilizzarli saranno ad esempio i laptop Lenovo IdeaPad 1.I portatili equipaggiati con le APU Mendocino di AMD costeranno tra 399 e 699 euro e supporteranno sia Windows che Chrome OS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Git is a brilliant tool. It simplifies the version control process and it allows users to easily share and contribute code to each other. Git is also system and content agnostic. This means that it can run on any platform, which makes it a highly useful and sought after tool for programmers and casual users alike.
    
One issue with Git, however, is that it requires you to use a command-line utility to fully use its functions. This means that in order to use Git you need to learn a number of commands specific to it. However, if you are using Emacs there can be a better way.
    
Magit is a powerful front-end for Git in Emacs. It allows you to easily and seamlessly use Git in Emacs to create, manipulate and save Git repositories through simple Emacs keybindings. Not only that, Magit also automatically adapts existing Git repositories through its interface. This means that you can install Magit right now and immediately use it to manage version control.

This is only an issue with direct input via the 3.5mm jack, it doesn't happen over bluetooth. It starts, regularly, about 5 seconds after I end playback. The hum amplifies when I touch parts of the speaker's metal chassis, which makes me worried there's a grounding issue.
 This person seems to have had the same issue, but the guide they say (partially) fixed it links to a website with an expired certificate.

        <updated>2022-05-23T11:48:31.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to get hardware video acceleration to work using Firefox on a Kaby Lake CPU (Core i5 8350U) with an UHD 620 iGPU. Here's what I did so far according to the wiki.
 Installed intel-media-driver, libva-intel-driver and lib32-libva-intel-driver, libvdpau-va-gl, libva-vdpau-driver.
 I verified that the following VA-API codecs can be decoded: MPEG2, H264, VC1, VP8, HEVC, VP9 and the following can be encoded: MPEG2, H264, VP8, HEVC using libva-utils.
 And even though the CPU should be able to decode VP9 vdpauinfo is only showing H264 decoder capabilities. But I also realized that the i915 driver is loaded and not the iHD one (according to inxi -G).
 But journalctl | grep "iHD" shows the following:
  
May 23 13:32:19 laptop plasmashell[16880]: libva info: User environment variable requested driver 'iHD'May 23 13:32:19 laptop plasmashell[16880]: libva info: Trying to open /usr/lib/dri/iHD_drv_video.so
  
I also tried configuring VA-API by setting the LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME environment variable to iHD in my .bashrc but it still loads i915. Or did I maybe misunderstood this?
 I tried setting VDPAU_DRIVER=va_gl which also appeared to do nothing.
 In Firefox I configured the following according to the wiki:
  
Compositing is using WebRender.
 Set gfx.webrender.all to true.
 Set media.ffmpeg.vaapi.enabled to true.
 Set media.rdd-ffmpeg.enabled to true (default).
 Set media.ffvpx.enabled to false.
 Set media.navigator.mediadatadecoder_vpx_enabled to true.
 Set media.rdd-vpx.enabled to false.
  
Despite doing all this, intel_gpu_top is showing no load on Video.
 Should I only install intel-media-driver or libva-intel-driver? Or is it okay to have both installed and let the system choose the correct driver?
 Is it intended behavior that inxi is showing the i915 driver being used?
 Am I missing anything for Firefox 100.0.2 that's maybe not in the wiki?

Meta Releases Facebook “Widely-Viewed Content Report”
    
Meta’s release of the 2022 Q1 widely-viewed content report explains that it has changed the way the list of the top 20 links shared on Facebook is calculated.
    
Previously, this report included all links that were shared on Facebook. However, it was criticized for including links that didn’t show a preview. This gave leverage to Facebook Pages that shared links with hidden spam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have installed vanilla Arch with KDE Plasma 5.24.5.
 The default volume step is at 5% i.e. from 50% volume up => 55% and volume down => 45%.
 Now, if I change this step to 3%, things become weird. From 50% volume down => 45% then 42% then 39% and then volume up from 39% => 46% then 49% then 52%.
 Similarly, if I set volume step to 7%, the first change is of 3% and then subsequent changes are of 7% in both up and down.
 Why is this happening and how to fix this. I couldn't find any helpful article or wiki page for this.
 Note: It works perfectly in KDE Neon.
 Solution
 As mentioned by u/Viritox, uninstall kmix and then restart your system. If you can't control volume keys, try binding keys in Settings > Shortcuts > Audio Volume

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an IFI hip dac plugged in to my laptop with pipewire. I am seeing two output devices. First is Analog Output HD USB Audio --- Analog Stereo Output. The other one is Digital Output (S/PDIF) HD USB Audio --- Digital Stereo (IC958) Output. Both of these have sound. I'm wondering which is the correct choice to get the best possible sound from my DAC.
 I've done some searches and there's been some conflicting information. Some accepted solutions say that picking Digital Output bypasses the laptop's built-in DAC and sends the digital signal to the external DAC directly without any processing, but I'm not sure if that's correct. I've read the Pipewire FAQ (https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire/-/wikis/FAQ#what-are-those-analog-stereo-and-digital-stereo-iec958-profile) but it's not much help, or maybe I just don't get it since I'm new to Linux audio.
 Tl;dr: which of these two is the "correct" and better sounding option for a DAC connected through USB: Analog Output or Digital Output? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

They seem to be behaving as though there is no nvidia gpu in my system. i have an rtx 2060. how can i get the drivers to work with my gpu?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just installed arch and am trying to connect to my remote server via ssh and it is not working. I type the command in like "ssh -p 8000 [me@myserver.org](mailto:me@myserver.org)" and it does nothing and looks like it's just waiting there forever, I've waited up to 30 minutes several times just to see if it would do anything but it doesn't and I end up having to use ctrl+c on it. If I disconnect from my network and try it again it instantly says "ssh: connect to host 0.0.27.84 port 22: Network is unreachable" which is not even close to the address or port that I entered. I currently dual boot and it works in windows. I've searched everywhere and haven't found any similar issues so if anyone could help or point me in the right direction, it would be very much appreciated.

 To change the install script would I have to rebuild the iso or is it possible to do it directly on the USB?

 This was a super annoying bug.
 Here are easy steps to fix this.
  
Install gnome-disk-utility - sudo pacman -S gnome-disk-utility
 Install ntfs-3g - sudo pacman -S ntfs-3g
 Open gnome-disk-utility
 Select the device you would like to mount
 Select the partition you would like to mount
 There should be either a gear or triangle inside a square. Click on it. (https://i.imgur.com/gBAdsUJ.png if you need to be sure what to click)
 You should get a menu. Click "Edit Mount Options"
 Turn off user session defaults
 Make sure that "Mount at system startup" is checked/highlighted
 You can change the mount point if you want. Default is 100% fine, though.
 Click ok and enter your password
 Restart and it should now mount by default

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have installed nvidia-open-dkms and based on [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA) it should have the related udev-rule to create NVENC required device in /dev but on OBS Studio I have issue with NVENC, and it cannot find it. Also, I don't have anything on /dev/bus/pci. Besides, I have an udev-rule under my /usr/lib for NVIDIA, which is different from the on recommend on Arch Wiki.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tried to switch to the ntfs3-dkms-git driver, however, now all the files that were created in Windows are owned by root when mounted using NTFS3. Is there a way to fix that? Moving to NTFS-3G could be a nice option, but still NTFS3 is still preferable for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the wiki of KMS , in the Early Kernel Mode Settings paragraph, it was written "MODULES=(... i915 ...)" are these dots mandatory or is it just here to say that there can be other modules written before and after i915 in mkinitcpio.conf? Also lsmod gave me -
 intel_agp 24576 0
 intel_gtt 28672 2 intel_agp,i915
 Does it mean my intel_agp isn't loaded? Thank you for your precious time.
