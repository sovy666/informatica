        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey. Since the upgrade to Gnome 42 my window capture is broken. But this only affects OBS, Discord and other programs just capture things fine in wayland.
 I can select PipeWire as a capture method. And it also sees the windows, but if I select any of them the preview is just gray.
 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/483318095985770517/962150875231576184/unknown.png?width=556&height=468https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/483318095985770517/962151215230246954/unknown.png?width=854&height=468
 Im using latest Nvidia 510 drivers and the zen kernel. I also installed xdg-desktop-portal and xdg-desktop-portal-gnome. OBS (27.2.4) is from flatpak (also tried the one from official repo)
 EDIT: Just saw that journalctl reports
 gnome-shell\[38192\]: Invalid buffer data
 Has anyone encountered this?
 Thanks in advance!

 My first thought was; "Why not just install a Deb based system?" And then I remembered; this is the Arch way.
 I'm quite intrigued by this conjecture.
 Is it possible to get a mostly debian based setup using the packages for Debian? 
 Does dpkg replace pacman, or work independently for Just a debian based Arch Install?

 problem: black screen with cursor, able to open up krunner to open windows, no windows manager at all
 I thought I had a KDE Plasma issue. I read posts about uninstalling all KDE git packages and reinstalling non-git ones, but I found no git ones installed. then when I realized it was a KWin problem, I saw that I had kwin-low-latency installed instead of kwin
 solution: install kwin instead of kwin-low-latency
 tl;dr -- IF YOU HAVE KWIN-LOW-LATENCY, REPLACE WITH KWIN!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When using Windows, you’ll notice that it comes with its own antivirus called Windows Defender (now called Windows Security in later versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11). For some, Windows Defender is more of a hindrance than a help. As such, they’ll want to disable Windows Defender completely. As you’ll discover in this tutorial, disabling Windows Defender isn’t as easy as it should be. Regardless, making sure Defender goes down and stays down isn’t very tricky at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wanted to add couple more arguments to MPV so i copied it's desktop file from /usr/share/applications to ~/.local/share/applications and did my alterations to Exec. It worked, but now, for some reason, it is no longer the default application for anything. Or, more specifically, things like file managers no longer see it as such, however xdg-open still opens the files without issues and xdg-mime query default video/x-matroska still reports mpv.desktop.
 I tried removing the MIME part of the override's desktop file and removing the original file from usr, under the assumptions i might have made it ambiguous - nothing fixes it, except removing my override altogether.
 I'm not entirely sure what causes it, since it works with the xdg tools perfectly fine. I checked ArchWiki's entries for XDG Desktop and MIME but there wasn't anything about this issue. Thoughts?
 (inb4 - i don't use a DE so i can't just look up defaults in GUI there)
 UPD: Ok, i think i figured it out: i needed to run update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications. I guess that was on me since i go used to rofi picking up desktop entries by itself without needing to manually update the database, and for assuming that running the command by itself would try to update the current user's database, not the one in /usr/.
 Still no idea why presence of mpv.desktop in the local applications nullifies the MIME associations for it already present in the /usr/ though

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the winter, I decided to start mining xmr to heat up my room. I had just repurposed my old computer into a server that was just sitting there doing nothing, and I decided to let it go ham on mining. The temperature started to warm up again. Therefore, I stopped mining.
 ​
 All of a sudden, I am having stability problems left and right with my server. I've updated the bios, left it on default settings (which unfortunately means I'm running 2133Mhz on 3200Mhz ddr4). Cleared cmos. Everything!!!
 ​
 I decided to let it start mining, and voila! stable. It's been up 3 days without a freeze whereas before it would only go 40 minutes without hard freezing.
 ​
 Advice would be appreciated. FYI, i just ran the server quickstart in the archinstall script.

Il predecessore di Windows 3.1 fu accolto positivamente dall'industria e dagli utenti finali ma mancava di componenti chiave, soffriva di tanti difetti (bug), usava font bitmap e veniva espressamente presentato come una sorta di add-on per MS-DOS.Rendendosi conto della necessità di rimanere competitivi con i Mac di Apple e in vista del salto ai 32 bit con il successivo Windows 95, Microsoft aveva assolutamente necessità di stringere i tempi e rilasciare Windows 3.1 nel più breve tempo possibile.]]></summary>

For example the phrase:"Existe um longo histórico de erros técnicos" print as "Existe um longo hist rico de erros t cnicos".
 This is not a font, bash, or terminal emulator problem. vim and others parts of the terminal, the accents are printed just fine.
 The packages aspell, the dictionary aspell-pt are up do date.
 One yer ago aspell was working in portuguese and english texts, since then there have been NO updates in this packages, so I suspect that this issue is caused by and update on some aspell dependence.
 Aspell is correcting the words correctly, the only issue is not printing characters with portuguese accents.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a battle between me and my system; so far the system is winning.
 I have what I suspect is a standard setup with ALSA and PulseAudio, with Jack for help in playing MIDI files. I'd like to replace PulseAudio with Pipewire, but attempts to add any Pipewire packages leads to conflicts with PulseAudio, which I can't remove as it's needed for something else... and so on.
 Last week I could use speakertest in the terminal, and also play MP3 files using mpg123. Today - remarkably enough - I can still play MP3 files, but I can't use speakertest; I get an error that 
 Unable to set hw params for playback: Cannot allocate memory 
 Setting of hwparams failed: Cannot allocate memory
 Well, I can live without speakertest. At least I can play MP3s.
 What I can't do though, is get any sound from my browser with streaming services like YouTube. And this is constant across all browsers; at least the ones I've tried. (Chrome, Firefox, Vivaldi.)
 But surely, getting sound working shouldn't be that hard? All I want is for sound to, you know, work. It's crazy that it's as difficult and as non-intuitive as it seems to be.
 Anyway, if anybody has any bright ideas about how to manage sound (my machine is a Lenovo X1 Carbon 3rd generation), I'd be thrilled.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you have tried to dual boot your Windows system with Linux, then you probably encountered some changes that may not be welcome. When installing Linux in this environment, the GRUB bootloader will overwrite the Windows bootloader within the Master Boot Record (MBR).
    
This is also true in reverse: If you have installed Linux first and then decide to install Windows, the Windows bootloader will overwrite GRUB. You will then find that there is no way to boot into your Linux Desktop.
    
Lastly, any major change in Windows can also modify your bootloader rendering it unusable. This is the case for the Anniversary Update in Windows 10 and the Windows 11 upgrade.
    
Any of these scenarios can be problematic for the new user, but thankfully with a little patience and care, there are ways to restore the bootloader, and in the process, repair the MBR.

È inoltre possibile usare JavaScript come linguaggio di scripting e MonoDevelop come IDE per coloro che vogliono un'alternativa a Visual Studio.Quasi tutto può essere animato con Unity: i creatori di contenuti e gli artisti se ne servono per creare scene 3D o costruire animazioni 2D da zero. Poiché Unity esiste ormai dal 2005 ha potuto raccogliere un enorme seguito di utenti in tutti questi anni e portare a maturazione un'incredibile libreria di risorse.

 When the battery enters a fully-charged state, the status is reported as Unknown. Is this a case where I am missing a package necessary for the battery status to be reported properly? Web searches showed several similar issues, but they all seemed to involve batteries that refused to charge. In my case, the battery appears to be working fine. Additionally, the status is correctly reported as Discharging when unplugged, and Charging when charging. It's only when the battery gets full that it starts showing Unknown.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I dont know where else too post this so here we go. I set up an wireguard server with pivpn on an orangepi pc. Also tried it manually but with the same result. The server works like it should, I can connect to it from my smartphone or my laptop. On my laptop I imported the wireguard config in network manager. Everything works as expected, it even automatically connects to the VPN after suspend or hibernate and also after disabling and reenabling WiFi in the gnome settings. However as soon as I switch to an different WiFi network NetworkManager goes complete nuts. The nmcli command line program as well as the gnome network settings become completely unresponsive. While I can ping IP addresses with ping and resolve hostnames with nslookup no websites load and trace route gets stuck after some hops. Rebooting fixes the issue. Neighter dmesg nor journalctl give any relevant info, they behave like nothing happened except for ah coredump when gnome-settings crashes. I tried some of the dns related stuff in the wiki like the systemd-resolved symlink or using openresolv but that didn't change a thing. I honestly have no idea where to take it from here. Maybe someone knows what's wrong. 
 Thanks in advance
 Edit: The config nmcli import created(minus the keys and endpoint address):

 Thank you everyone for the replies!
 I had Steam installed through multilib, and my solution was simply to remove it and install it through Flatpak. It works fine now, will do further testing with the rest of the games.
 Hopefully this helps anyone with the same problem!
 ORIGINAL POST:
 I installed Arch freshly yesterday and everything is doing fine, except that all Steam games running through Proton crash immediately after launch. This has never happened to me on previous Arch installs, and I don't think I did anything different.
 I read online and found that Proton doesn't work well with NTFS partitions but mine are all ext4.
 Has anyone faced this issue?
 If so, help would be appreciated since I don't really want to do a clean install risking it just won't work again.
 Thanks!

Questa evoluzione è stata principalmente guidata dalle innovazioni che AMD ha introdotto con la sua architettura Zen anche se non va posta in secondo piano le risposta di Intel arrivata con i processori Tiger Lake prima e poi con gli Alder Lake di dodicesima generazione.Molto è successo dall'arrivo sul mercato dei processori Ryzen 1000, una generazione di CPU AMD che ha rivoluzionato il panorama dei chip e portato il confronto con la rivale Intel a un nuovo livello.Per capire meglio la portata delle modifiche che sono state introdotte con AMD Zen basti pensare che dal momento dell'introduzione degli Intel Core 2 nel 2006 i processori quad-core erano rimasti lo standard ad alte prestazioni per il mercato mainstream: ogni rilascio di Intel nel mercato dei processori consumer tra il 2006 e il 2017 è stato limitato a un massimo di quattro core e otto thread.]]></summary>

Are there any benefits to creating separate partition (like the one mentioned here https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-boot#Installation_using_XBOOTLDR) vs just holding kernel, ucodes, initramfs... inside /boot on root partition and mounting Windows EFI to /efi and installing bootloader there? From what I can tell both approaches avoid the "Windows EFI being too small" problem, but still put us at risk of Windows "accidentally" erasing our bootloader during update. Any thoughts?

When I input "pulseaudio" into the terminal, this is what I get back:
 E: [pulseaudio] pid.c: Daemon already running.
 E: [pulseaudio] main.c: pa_pid_file_create() failed.
 I've looked into Pavucontrol, and have played with the settings and tried everything on there, still the same problem.
 Also when I'm screensharing on Discord, there is no audio input or output in the stream.

It works with a wired connection but no wireless. Any thoughts? Tried using networkmananger, iwd, and the built-in KDE WiFi utility. No luck with any, it just says the network isn't found even on a mobile hotspot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys,
 I've recently installed Arch Linux on my UEFI system [NO DUAL BOOT]. I'd followed the exact same steps as mentioned in the Arch wiki installation page. Before proceeding with the installation, I had disabled the Secure Boot option from BIOS and after successful installation when I try to enable the Secure Boot option, the Arch Linux fails to boot.
 So, I'm trying to add Secure Boot to my Arch Linux installation using Shim-signed. From what I read on the Arch Wiki is that we need to have a .Sbat Section, or the EFI binaries won't load. But I couldn't get how to create one. Even after reading through this ReadME: https://github.com/rhboot/shim/blob/main/SBAT.md
 ​
 Please guide me on how to create a .sbat for shim-signed so that I can enable the Secure Boot.
 Please note: I have only Arch Linux installed on my system [NO DUAL BOOT].
 OS: Arch Linux x86_64
 Kernel: 5.15.32-1-lts [Linux-lts]
 Desktop Environment: GNOME 42.0

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I did my Arch install a long time ago using Gnome and Xorg I'm trying to switch to wayland. Would this still be the proper way of switching or is this method outdated?
 First, you need to enable NVIDIA kernel modesetting, to do this add the kernel parameter nvidia-drm.modeset=1. Next, ensure that GDM wayland isn't disabled (this isn't strictly necessary since you can launch GNOME from command line). Go to /etc/gdm/custom.conf, and comment out the waylandenable=false line if it is present. Next, you need to edit a udev rule. Edit /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/61-gdm.rules (location might vary based on distro, however its usually there). And comment out the line that mentions disabling wayland if NVIDIA proprietary driver is present. Reboot, you should now be able to use GNOME on Wayland on proprietary NVIDIA driver. And note again that you won't have Xwayland acceleration or it won't work at all, and that there are some NVIDIA eglstreams specific bugs, and that certian functions might have reduced performance compared to GBM.

 I've a bug that can't find any info and i can't fix it because i have literally no idea what the problem is. Only thing that comes to mind it's that is running on a virtual machine, but then again more people would have the problem.
 In settings or Extensions every time i need to press another button, like settings or add applications or keyboard shortcuts always happens 2 things, or the words disappear or the window becomes slightly darker and locks. If i press ESC it returns to normal but i can never go that extra step.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Manual vacuuming is becoming a thing of the past thanks to robot vacuums. The ILIFE A11 LiDAR Robot Vacuum wants you to be able to relax, travel, or just go about your day without having to think about this dreaded chore ever again. As both a vacuum and mop, it’s designed to handle all the dirty work so that you don’t have to. I recently had the opportunity to test out this robot vac.

Overview of Features
    
The ILIFE A11 LiDAR Robot Vacuum is a new release from ILIFE and features the latest LiDAR 2.0 technology. This is designed to boost mapping efficiency by 50 percent, thanks to a sampling rate of 3,000 samples per second and measurement areas of 26 feet.
    
The vacuum uses a CV-Slam algorithm to create more efficient and neat mapping patterns. This also helps to better clean along edges and corners that some vacuums... Read more]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just updated to GNOME 42 and oh my god my system wasn't this broken since a long time.
 Basically everything is worse. The desktop stutters like hell when external monitor is connected to my laptop. Animations aren't as smooth as they used to be. Dark/light mode feature only changes wallpapers and nothing else. Settings app gets bigger each time it's launched and it frequently crashes.
 I think I will discover many more bugs unless I just revert my system to GNOME 41.
 Is anyone's experience similar to mine? I use Xorg so maybe that's the issue but Wayland isn't really an option for me because of lack of support for reverse prime. Also if Xorg causes problems with new GNOME version then why support it in the first place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intel ha annunciato di aver tagliato un importante traguardo presso il suo stabilimento irlandese (Fab 34): la litografia ultravioletta estrema (EUV) è un processo costruttivo che permette di produrre, a partire dai wafer in silicio, chip sempre più miniaturizzati.Gli scanner litografici rappresentano la parte del processo produttivo che porta a realizzare un processore: stampano la microarchitettura di ogni singolo chip su un wafer di silicio scannerizzando un modello e trasferendone l'immagine sul wafer stesso che viene poi sviluppato. Sebbene gli scanner litografici facciano parte del processo produttivo dei chip da diversi anni, la più recente versione della tecnologia, EUV, consente di stampare i circuiti in dimensioni più ridotte e con una maggiore precisione.Azienda leader nella produzione di macchinari per l'utilizzo della soluzione EUV è l'olandese ASML, spesso tirata in ballo anche di recente quando si è parlato di Chips Act e degli sforzi europei per spostare una buona parte della produzione di chip nel vecchio continente entro il 2030.

Lo specifico sistema EUV prodotto da ASML e installato presso l'impianto Fab 34 di Intel in Irlanda è probabilmente il più complesso macchinario mai costruito: è composto da 100.000 parti, 3.000 cavi, 40.000 bulloni e più di un chilometro e mezzo di tubi.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ello peeps, I've made a custom personal arch repo a while back and it's serving me great, feel free to reuse it to build your own.
 My usage is:
  
place PKGBUILD files in pkgfiles
 execute repo_manager script which: 
 builds all of them to .tar.zst packages
 registers those in a repo database file all of which are located in repo/x86_64
 
  
I'm aiming to improve a couple things:
  
aur-like support I want to have the ability to simply put a PKGBUILD file in an aur folder and have my aur helper (I use paru) fetch and build it locally
 making repo_manager a bit smarter
  
the relevant functions are
 build_pkgbuild() { MAKEPKG_FLAGS=${1:-'-scC'} makepkg $MAKEPKG_FLAGS JUNK_FILES=`ls | grep -v 'PKGBUILD'` rm -rf $JUNK_FILES } build_all_pkgs() { for pkg in `ls $REPO_ROOT/pkgfiles`; do echo "building $pkg" cd "$REPO_ROOT/pkgfiles/$pkg" build_pkgbuild done } 
 now build_all_pkgs works fine but slow, it tries to build each PKGBUILD and skips with an error once it realizes that it's already up to date (according to pkgver and pkgrel within the PKGBUILD itself)
 as you can see each error takes about a second which is painful with many packages
 I'm hoping to have build_outdated_pkgs which should build only the PKGBUILDS that actually need building.
 I assume that I should query the database files (personal.db & personal.files) but idk how, seriously what are even those files, they sure aren't sqlite.
