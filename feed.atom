 I've looked online for answers, but nothing I found seems to work. Any ideas?

 I'm try to set my fans to 30% speed when my machine boots
 I've been using nvidia-settings to do it via CLI and even set up a small script to do a fan profile for me every changing every ~5C (before I discovered GreenWithEnvy )
 I'm using SDDM with Plasma. I tried adding the below to my /usr/share/sddm/scripts/Xsession
 nvidia-settings -a "[gpu:0]/GPUFanControlState=1" -a "[fan:0]/GPUTargetFanSpeed=30" -a "[fan:1]/GPUTargetFanSpeed=30" 
 It doesn't seem to activate when SDDM starts. It seems like nvidia-settings doesn't run at all unless a user is logged in graphically. To confirm this, I logged in to tty2 after SDDM started and was sitting at the user login screen. I ran nvidia-settings and it failed, however after adding DISPLAY=:0, it failes with a different error about MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE missing.
 Both of those are kind of beside the problem though. If this was a headless server that wasn't running X, how would I go about using nvidia-settings to set the fanspeed?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to share over wifi my ethernet connection, and have followed the "Software access point" tutorial on the wiki.
 I've created the wifi link layer without any issues, and managed to connect to it with my phone.
 I set up the NAT with iptables, copying pasting the commands from the wiki without understanding them very well. I substituted the interface names where necessary.
 The manual IP assignment is a bit mysterious on the wiki, so here is how I interpreted it:
 sudo ip address add 192.168.123.105/24 broadcast + dev wlo1 
 Where 192.168.123.105 is the IP address I wish for my phone to connect with.
 On my phone, I connected with the static IP setting, and chose this address and configured the DNS to 1.1.1.1.
 However, my phone says "No internet access" once it has connected to the access point. What did I do wrong and how can I troubleshoot it? Thanks in advance!

The only downside for me has always been the permanent mic stalk, as any gaming headset looks silly on the train or at times they’re used for your phone or other device. The EKSA E900 Pro Gaming Headset gets around this limitation in a couple of interesting ways and produces a set of headphones that are very decent in quality while being versatile as well. They score well in other areas too.

Nice Pro Features
    
Unboxing the EKSA E900 Pro headphones, you will find a nice chunky pair of gaming headphones with LEDs embedded on the outside of the earpieces, so you look super-cool in Zoom chats, but they also have some nice pro features. The mic is detachable, and although the headset is designed primarily to work via USB, you also have an additional cable... Read more]]></summary>

 Running pacman -Qkk gives me hundreds of warnings. And used to give an error for vtk.
 How did something like this even happen. Now that it has happened how can I fix it wthout creating a long delay again.

This is because Gentoo, by default, requires you to compile all the packages that you want to install. That approach allows you to change compile-time settings. This includes settings for various technologies which would not have been possible in a binary-based distribution.

After suspend, no input given to the laptop will cause the display to turn back on. The only thing I'm able to do is press the power button to turn the laptop off.
 Update: initially my kernel modules in /etc/mkinitcpio.conf were
 MODULES=(intel_agp i915 nvidia nvidia_modeset nvidia_uvm nvidia_drm) 
 I haven't tried every combination of these, but using
 MODULES=() 
 allows for recovering from suspend, although this seems like a bad idea

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to use the entire disk of my HP Elitebook (Intel i5-7300U @ 2.60GHz) to install Arch. Currently it contains Windows 10. I've read the install guide. It recommended to use the existing EFI partition ("If the disk from which you want to boot already has an EFI system partition, do not create another one, but use the existing partition instead.") 
 A few lines further down, in the example layout, the suggested minimum size for this partition is 300 Mb. I'm confused, because my existing partition is 99 Mb (see below). I would much rather start with a clean slate.
 So my question is twofold: can I ignore this advice about the existing EFI partition and what is the best way to start with an empty disk? And as an aside: do I need EFI at all?

 I tried doing "exec su - taha" Im getting the error "su: failed to execute /bin/zsh: Exec format error"
 Not sure what to do now. I cant launch sway or I3 from chroot either.
 Someone else had this problem but it was an architecture fault. Doing "file /bin/zsh" shows its x86-64

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[some days ago, I noticed that my video and audio sync doesn't match and the video looks like there's some frame drop.
 So I somehow investigated this issue and I found that "Video Encode/Decode Hardware acceleration" is disabled(from chrome://gpu) and on the normal hosts where there's no frame drop or sync mismatch, that feature is enabled. So I think if I could turn it on my issue would be gone.
 However I couldn't... I couldn't find any way to turn it on.. what should I configure or install?Is there anyone know how to enable hardware acceleration for linux host on VMware?
 I tried installing fresh images Windows 10, Ubuntu, Arch and Fedora. I checked them whether they support Hardware acceleration. Windows 10 enables Hardware acceleration but others not. So I think it isn't impossible to enable it on VMware I guess.
 thanks.
 P.S. I'm using Windows 11 host and the VMware version is 16. I'm using Fedora but I had been using Arch for long and it has the same issue so I posted this here.
 P.P.S I'm not good at English writing, so if you don't understand or have feedback, please leave a comment I'll elaborate it.

We weren't seeded by AMD for this launch, leading us to anticipate that it's not too good for Linux gaming / not their target market. But after the great success I've had with AMD Milan-X performance on Linux, I was very eager to try out this consumer CPU with the 3D-stacked L3 cache and ended up purchasing a 5800X3D. Indeed the Ryzen 7 5800X3D turned out to be disappointing for Linux gaming performance but the 5800X3D was very interesting for a range of other technical workloads and making me very excited for future Ryzen CPUs with 3D V-Cache.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have two significant issues that I'd like help with concerning my arch installation. 
 1) LightDM cannot start upon boot, but works fine if i sign in and then just tell it to start lightdm again. your classic "Failed to initialize Light Display Manager". It's only really a minor inconvenience as I have to do Ctrl+Atl+F2, sign in, and then "sudo systemctl start lightdm" and we're good, but if there is a fix, I'd like some help finding it as I've found some suggestions online of editing conf files and reinstalling the packages but that hasn't really been helping. 
 2) Monitor freezes at times when in fullscreen. The issue was worse on GNOME, as it was happening with youtube videos, mpv, and watching disney+ in a browser when fullscreen. However, it also would happen to games, where something might happen, i may get a desktop notification or I try upping my volume and the fullscreen image for the game freezes and the computer has to be hard shut off and restarted in order to get back to the desktop. to my chagrin, budgie still has the same issue. due to this, borderless window is preferred but a lot of games either just have fullscreen or windowed, so I'd like to get an idea of what would be the issue with the fullscreen freezing. 
 Switching DE's obviously wouldn't be preferrable. I switched from GNOME to Budgie in order to try to see if Budgie could fix some of the issues that my system would have with GNOME, but it seems that the fullscreen freezes, which is the bigger problem, carried over. Any help would be very much appreciated, thank you. 
 DE: Budgie
 WM: Mutter (Budgie)
 CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X
 GPU: ASUS AMD Radeon RX 6600 
 random thought that could be garbage. to my understanding, my GNOME install also used mutter as the WM, so I kind of wonder if the fullscreen issue is a WM problem..?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working on moving my main desktop from Windows to Linux, and I have some history with Arch so that was my first choice, but I am having a performance issue. I typically run gminer in the background all the time while I am using my system, and this doesn't cause any noticeable impact on Windows.
 I have been trying some different distros, and with PopOS and Fedora using proprietary nvidia drivers for my 3080Ti, I have the same experience where I can mine in the background and it doesn't appear to have any impact on the user experience.
 When I use anything Arch based though and install the nvidia DKMS drivers, I am getting very bad graphical lag when trying to use and move around windows while running gminer, to the point where the system isn't really useable.
 Some additional info: I am using GNOME in all the linux variations I have been testing, and I have enabled the full composition pipeline in nvidia settings on arch, but that didn't seem to make a difference. I have also tried with both normal Linux kernel and Zen kernel. I have tried archcraft, endeavour, manjaro, and xero for arch distributions to see if it was some weird distro specific thing, but I'm having the same issue on all of them.
 Any reason I would only be seeing the poor performance on Arch-based systems, and is there any way to optimize?

 Is there any fix for it?
 Thanks. Found fix.

 Any time I play music, the song constantly stutters, stopping and starting throughout the song. Cmus works perfectly, but I prefer ncmpcpp's interface and controls, and I want the ability to play the song in the background. I can post any extra information as necessary.
 Edit: If I set mpd to use PulseAudio instead of PipeWire, the stuttering stops entirely. Is there some setting for PipeWire that I'm missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, in my last thread I illustrated some weird glitchiness I was getting on a fresh install with the archinstall script.
 Turns out, the script did everything right but for some reason didn't create the home directory for the user, hence the Gnome preferences not being saved anywhere, the inability to change a wallpaper, to add icons to the dock, to set a font and keyboard layout.
 Hopefully this helps

 my arch linux terminal (alacritty and st) can't render the correct nert font icon, but it works on the mac alacritty with the same config and font(Hack Nerd Font Mono). Also i use dwm as my window manager. Here is the images: mac alacritty and arch alacritty
 I am not sure it is caused by arch or dwm or something else, but it troubles me, so i ask it here and hope to solve this.
 And Thanks guys.
