 Steam gives this error when trying to run after updating nvidia drivers, after looking at other forum posts and checking the nvidia package versions they're all matching.
 They have a GT 1030 if that helps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[i've been wanting to build a graphical live medium for arch linux for a long time. and i finally got around to creating one. it contains the exact same packages as the standard arch iso. and in addition it boots directly into a xfce desktop with a bunch of graphical tools at your disposal (web browser, text editor, etc.).
 use cases:
  
install arch linux according to official installation guide.
 a rescue system to fix a broken linux install (f.x. fix the bootloader after a defective kernel upgrade).
 a portable linux system for your bunch of keys. ready-to-use wherever you go.
  
there is a github repo with all the required data. you can build (and run) it yourself:
  sudo pacman -S archiso git clone https://github.com/flying-dude/efly sudo mkarchiso -v efly-live run_archiso -i out/efly-linux-2022.05.08-x86_64.iso 
 i'd highly appreciate some feedback, if the produced iso image works properly on your system.
 there is some stuff planned to be added to the live system. an important one is configuring it with proper fan control for the cpu. currently the fan just runs with high speed on my system regardless of cpu usage.

 I want to change to arch, should i be worried about hardware comp and other stuff?
 i know that i will need to basicly relearn the package manager but that will be no problem. 
 once i downloaded a arch based distro (don't remember wich) and said that i need special firmware for my in board ethernet card (Broadcom NetLink BCM57788) and didn't find it so i just went back to debian-kde at the time.
 also can i use my /home directory or is there something special about it on arch? also hold my xorg and other config files. 
 (i use dwm and startx)
 thanks and sorry for my english.

The computer hibernates but when attempting to resume, the screen is black and I'm fairly certain that the computer is not registering input or running any resumed programs.
 I've gone through this debugging guide and all the test modes work as expected. Suspending the system works as well. It only seems to be proper hibernation that doesn't work.
 I tried switching over to the LTS kernel but the issue persists. It used to work so this isn't a hardware issue.
 What other things can be done to troubleshoot this issue?

 Is there a reason for the python-wxpython package being held back?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. Recently i found a great feature about mounting sshfs on deman, so I tried to set it up and found a strange problem. I mounted some servers to the /home/igormahov/sshfs/server1, .../server2, etc. When I'm using Dolphin and visiting my home directory, it tries to "ping" all these mounts by mounting them and unmounting immediately. The problem is that there is one server which is turned off most of the time and the "ping" for it hangs, causing the freeze of the Dolphin and the whole filesystem. The only temporary solution is to kill all ps aux | grep sshfs processes and to forcibly umount this directory (without unmounting, the Dolphin tries to "ping" it again after the refresh of files list). Is there any way to get rid of this problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've installed Arch on a Virtual Box with the Archinstall script. It didn't install sudo so I had to do that myself which was easy enough once I figured it out. Now im trying to edit the file with vim under visudo in root, and make it so wheel group has access to sudo commands. I honestly have no idea how to use vim, I don't know how to save the file or anything and theres several swap files in memory that I don't know how to get rid of.

 cp:can not create directory :'/run/initramfs/' no such file or directory
 I'm trying to get go-luks-suspend to work, which requires the shutdown hook to chroot into the initramfs, or /run/initramfs. However, it is not able to do so if the shutdown hook fails. I don't know how to even get started with debugging this problem, searching on the internet didn't do any good for me. I already looked into the source code of go-luks-suspend, so if you say the shutdown hook really is deprecated, and tell me how to chroot to initramfs without that, I might be able to make the necessary changes in go-luks-suspend itself.

 This error is from Xorg.0.log file. I have been experiencing a lot of tearing issues on my arch install and I believe it is due to incorrect drivers. I tried reading the wiki but couldn't solve this problem.

VO: [gpu] 1366x768 vaapi[nv12] 
 but when I play the same video with LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=i965 contraint the errors disappear:

 Maybe this will help in tracing the problem. I don't know if this is another issue entirely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Screensavers aren’t technically necessary in today’s age of low-energy LCD, OLED and IPS panels. Traditionally, screensavers were used to prevent burn-in on heat-emitting CRT monitors, which isn’t something modern monitors need to worry about. The reality is that if you actually want to preserve your screen, you just switch it off!
    
Still, screensavers can look super-pretty, and whether you want one for nostalgic reasons or to show off the eye-popping colors of your IPS monitor, it’s up to you. You can still use screensavers in Windows 10 and Windows 11, so we’ve gathered the best ones for you here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I am pretty sure it's easy topic but cannot find any info about proper way of doing it.
 I configure my dzen2 panel under bspwm and sometimes I need to provide additional information on some command.
 In my specific case I have a list of AP SSID got by
 nmcli d wifi | awk -v col=3 '{if (NR>1) {print $col}}'
 and would like to connect to specific network with click.
 So if network is already in nmcli c I can just run nmcli c up SSID, but the problems begins when I need to provide password to run
 nmcli d wifi connect SSID password PASS
 So, how can I do that? Is my overall approach good? And is there some common practice to provide an intermiediate popup for providing input and then run command? I know I could probably use some NetworkManager tool that have it integrated, but I see more usecases (e.g. I have list of commands to run and some of them can get extra parameters)
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys!
 I've been setting up my Linux machine for work. But lately I had some core dumps errors.
 Some of the programs I encountered are these:
 - Autodesk Maya (Fixed restoring with timeshift)
 -SideFX houdini (munmap_chunk(): invalid pointer [1] 97909 IOT instruction (core dumped) )
 -Qt5ct (lightly-qt error)
 ​
 I feel like there's more programs that could be affected, I'll edit the post if I encounter them.
 I don't know what's causing this, I never had this problem before. Anyone knows any way to source the error and fix it?
 Thanks in advance.
