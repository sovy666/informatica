Even though usually just new IDs are often needed and sometimes needing to adjust offsets or other minor changes, it has traditionally been done post-launch and sometimes left up to patches from the open-source community. Thankfully that has been changing and with Zen 4 it looks like that support will be ready for launch-day with the mainline Linux kernel...]]></summary>

Here we will show you how to map a WebDAV drive in Windows so you can access your remote files directly in File Explorer.
    
In order to connect to the WebDAV directory in Windows, you’ll need the WebDAV site URL, your WebDAV account login details, and a name for the shortcut or connection. All three allow you to map WebDAV by mounting its folder as a mapped drive so you can view, edit, or delete files from the remote web server using your computer.

 So my question is: Can I change that behavior to isolate the super key when I'm using my VDI? 
 For example, if I'm typing inside the VDI and I hit the super key, it just opens the startup menu from the VDI and not both the VDI and the desktop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nelle scorse settimane vi avevamo dato per certo l'arrivo di Thunderbird su Android sotto forma di app dedicata.Thunderbird è infatti uno dei client di posta elettronica più apprezzati per i sistemi Windows, macOS e Linux. Mozilla non ha però mai rilasciato un client email per i dispositivi mobili.La notizia è che Thunderbird per Android sarà costruito partendo dalle solide fondamenta della nota app K-9 Mail.È dal 2018, infatti, che Ryan Lee Sipes, Product Manager di Thunderbird, e Christian Ketterer, responsabile dello sviluppo di K-9 Mail si confrontavano sulla possibilità di 'unire le forze' e realizzare un client di posta per i dispositivi Android senza ripartire da zero.Così oggi arriva la conferma: K-9 Mail si trasformerà in Thunderbird per Android. L'attuale applicazione K-9 Mail cambierà nome e utilizzerà il nome e il marchio Thunderbird.'Prima che ciò accada dobbiamo raggiungere alcuni traguardi di sviluppo che porteranno K-9 Mail ad allinearsi con l'insieme di funzionalità e l'aspetto visivo di Thunderbird' per i sistemi desktop, si legge in una nota ufficiale.Tante funzionalità saranno quindi a breve aggiunte in K-9 Mail: la configurazione dell'account utilizzando il rilevamento e l'impostazione automatica di Thunderbird; la gestione delle cartelle migliorata; il supporto per i filtri dei messaggi; la sincronizzazione tra client desktop e mobile Thunderbird.Già oggi K-9 Mail supporta una casella di posta unificata, la gestione di identità multiple, il supporto per i messaggi crittografati con GPG e PGP/MIME, l'assegnazione di etichette e 'marcatori' alle varie email, le notifiche per singolo account e molto altro ancora.A questo punto è lecito aspettarsi che K-9 Mail supporti a sua volta, come fa Thunderbird desktop, anche l'autenticazione via OAuth.]]></summary>

Somehow the /dev configuration changed. Before NixOS install, Arch was on /dev/sda. When I installed NixOS, Arch moved to /dev/sdb. (I have 2 1TB SSDs in this machine along with a 4TB HDD and a 6TB HDD). Lesson learned, always check with lsblk before running an installation!
 So long story short, I accidentally wrote NixOS onto the Arch drive. Luckily, I was using the 6TB drive as my /home drive so all of my configuration files and stuff were intact.

 I wanted to print something from Arch, so I needed to install print-manager. It wouldn't work because of the mirrors returning a 404, so I just updated using "sudo pacman -Syu", and then installing print-manager worked. 
 Well when I rebooted my computer, everything went normal until the moment when the GUI is supposed to pop up, instead my monitors just show "Input Not Supported" and that's it. 
 I tried appending "init=/bin/bash" to Arch Linux in the GRUB menu to get into the command line or whatever, which worked, but then my keyboard didn't work. I couldn't type anything. I tried with multiple keyboards.
 What can I do? I'm new to Linux, so I'm not sure what else I can try to revert the update I did. I really don't want to lose the stuff I've got on there :(

Lo schema di collegamento prevede una base station e delle antenne che hanno il ruolo di coprire con il segnale wireless una specifica area geografica. Qualunque dispositivo degli utenti viene poi collegato alla rete attraverso una connessione di backhaul realizzata sempre in modalità senza fili oppure in fibra ottica.Nelle reti mobili la RAN consiste nella rete di accesso radio: essa ha subito un'evoluzione continua fino ad arrivare alle più recenti soluzioni 5G.Lo standard 5G NR (5G New Radio) descrive la più recente versione dell'interfaccia e della tecnologia di accesso radio.L'interfaccia supporta più bande di frequenza, comprese le frequenze sub-6 gigahertz e le onde millimetriche (mmWave) sopra il 30 GHz. Le bande mmWave offrono velocità di download superiori a 1 Gbps anche se il raggio di copertura è molto limitato.

Like suggested by Google results, I fetched info about my kernel and it seems ashmem is nowhere to be found. I am running latest version of everything since I update less than an hour ago.
 Binder is present, my results are:
 ```
  
uname -r 5.18.3-zen1-1-zen
 cat /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/modules.builtin | grep ashmem
 cat /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/modules.builtin | grep android kernel/drivers/android/binder.ko
 sudo modprobe -a ashmem_linux modprobe: WARNING: Module ashmem_linux not found in directory /lib/modules/5.18.3-zen1-1-zen
 sudo modprobe -a ashmem modprobe: WARNING: Module ashmem not found in directory /lib/modules/5.18.3-zen1-1-zen
  
```
 What's happening?
 thank you

 Around January 2022, I moved from Manjaro to Arch. I used the text base installer which made it really easy. For a while, I thought I had arch running flawlessly on two machines. In April or May, I ran pacman -Syuu'. After a reboot everything seems to works. However a few weeks later, I began to notice that pacman stopped getting updates. This is happening on both machines. It just returns a prompt with no error or info. Any suggestions ?

 I installed arch by connecting to the network and typing archinstall, everything is fine, it asked me if I wanted to use a separate home partition, and since yes was the default option, I selected it.
 But now I notice something, when I open Disk Usage Analyzer, I see 12 Gb available on my archlinux drive. I guess this is the / partition, so I think it's normal but when I click on the home folder, I can't see any free space
 Is the home folder in Disk Usage Analyzer going to get bigger when I add files?
 Have I done something wrong during the installation?
 ​
 In GParted the partitions are:
 ​
  
 Partition File System Mount Point Size Used Unused 
  
 /dev/sda1 fat32 /boot 511.0 MiB 71.71 MiB 439.29 MiB 
  /dev/sda2 ext4 / 19.50 GiB 7.81 GiB 11.69 GiB 
  /dev/sda3 ext4 /home 218.47 GiB 5.13 GiB 213.34 GiB 
 
 But if /home is so big, why can't I see empty space in Disk Usage Analyzer?
 Is it normal or is something wrong?
 ​
 ​
 Edit: Flatpak used a lot of space, i am now doing this to fix it

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys!
 (In case you're not interested in reading all this, thing I'd understand, please consider reading my questions at the end)
 I didn't know exactly where to write this question, but here's the thing.
 I've created USB bootables in a lot of ways. I was more used to creating them through interface programs. The fact is, I always used to have some kind of problem when creating them by console.
 Months ago I discovered the Arch wiki, it's been such a blessing to me. I'm learning a lot of topics and thanks to it I find myself improving on Linux.
 But here comes what happened. The other day I was looking how to create a bootable disk on the wiki. After reading on a lot of websites, I got to this line.
 "Make sure that it is not mounted."
 That simple sentence made my mind explode. All these years having issues trying to create a bootable through the console. I've formatted a drive multiple times just to make sure I understood. So I unmount the file system, and then I use some of the commands.
 Conclusion: My problems creating a bootable disk are gone.
 But I'm a curious person, and I always like to understand everything, so... Here I go!
 Questions
  
Why do we need to unmount the file system in order to write the iso to the drive?
 
Why does the process usually fail when the file system is mounted?
 
What is happening exactly when I do something like "cat arch.iso > /dev/sdx"?
 
And maybe this is a weird question, but why exactly does that work and not "cat arch.iso > /dev/sdx1" is it because the .iso file itself is like doing disk1(iso) > disk2(drive)?
 
 I'm still pretty newbie related some Linux things.
 I appreciate your patience just for the fact of reading all this. I look forward to see if I can understand whatever you explain! Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many arch users install both a kernel package of their choice and an additional kernel as a sort of "backup". This does not provide as much robustness as it could, largely due to what seems like an easily fixable design issue with pacman/dkms/mkinitcpio.
 For example, I have both the linux and linux-lts packages installed, and by default mkinitcpio creates both an autodetect and a fallback initramfs for both kernels, resulting in a total of 4 different images. One would expect that having 4 different initramfs to choose from would provide some robustness against boot issues.
 But it turns out that if you do a full pacman system update, it can apparently remove all the old vmlinuz and initramfs images from /boot/ before generating new ones. This seems to be related to dkms, as the /boot/ images are no longer present after the '70-dkms-install.hook' is invoked, but are only recreated by mkinitcpio after dkms is done (which depending on the number of dkms modules * number of kernels may take a while, e.g. a minute or so). So if your computer crashes during that vulnerable interval between the deletion of all the old /boot/ images at the same time and the generation of the new ones, you will end up with nothing to boot from.
 This issue seems entirely preventable by simply making sure that the /boot/ files are replaced sequentially, i.e. if pacman is called to update two or more kernels at the same time, do not let anything erase the /boot/ files related to two or more kernels simultaneously, but do it one after the other; do not touch any /boot/ files related to the second kernel while the first kernel is getting updated, and only begin updating the images related to the second kernel after the initramfs and vmlinuz images have already been generated for the first.

This is why I understand now that Arch Linux is not the distro for the daily Ubuntu Desktop user and Linux beginner in general, which does not mean that people shouldn't take a look of course!

Then SteamOS updated and suddenly nothing was working. When i type sudo easytether-usb or bluetooth into the Konsole, it tells me that command doesn't exist. When i try reinstalling EasyTether it tells me its already installed. So I am at a bit of a loss here. I'm learning a lot about Linux fairly well, but I am still learning. There is a lot I still don't yet know.

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQgyW10xD8s 
 Following the tutorial, he installs grub, efibootmgr, os-prober, dosfstools, and mtools. A new directory is created under the /boot directory called EFI. From root, he then runs: 
 grub -install --target=x86_64-efi --bootloader-id=grub_uefi --recheck 
 to allow grub installer to check for the EFI directory. This executes without errors for him. When I run it, I cannot get the installer to recognize the newly created EFI directory. The hint produced stated that systemd is referencing an old fstab and that I need to restart the daemon, but I can't as, while being chroot'd, the command is ignored. 
 My fstab has a dev/sda3 partition (my root) with an ext4 file system mounted to root '/'. dev/sda2 is a swap partition, and lastly, the dev/sda1 is a FAT32 partition that's mounted to the /boot directory. 
 I appreciate any guidance offered. I have checked the Wiki, but I can't find anything with my particular error. Please forgive a lowly Ubuntu user. 
 TIA.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, since about two months, resuming from hibernation after running systemctl hibernate does not work and the monitor shows no video output.
 Setup: I configured hibernation into a swap file and kernel parameters according to this wiki page, and had everything working for the past ~5 years. I'm not aware of any recent changes that might be related.
 Error Description: Going into hibernation works without issues. After waking up I get into grub and select the entry for launching Arch Linux. Then I get a blinking cursor for some time, after which I would usually get back to my desktop, but since recently I'm only getting a black screen with the monitor telling me "No Signal" after a while.
 What I tried so far:
  
Using an older kernel version
 Using LTS kernel
 Trying to (blindly) open a terminal or switch to a different TTY and run poweroff to see whether the error is only related to video output. But since the PC didn't turn off and it doesn't show as active network device in my router I assume that the resume is failing.
 Removing all modules from early KMS as suggested by the troubleshooting section of the wiki page linked above
  
My main issue right now is that I can't find any information on how to debug the problem. If anyone has any suggestions or some information is missing please let me know.

 I am setting up homeserver for selfhosted stuff. Truenas scale in a VM is going to be serving as a NAS. It is centered around zfs, and I wanted to test that I can just unplug the disk out, put it elsewhere and access data. Would go for open media vault if it felt like cumbersome process.
 The above process took me surprisingly long, as I spent time dicking with repos and switching kernels and reading whatnot... 
 When all that is needed is the zfs dksm modul and then import the disk. Somehow I went in with the impression I am about to do a rocket surgery.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks,
 first time posting here, so I hope I can ask my question clear enough.
 I just performed a very basic installation of arch with stock xMonad and qtile. The main thing that I couldn't quite figure out just yet, is how to lock my laptop (slock) whenever it suspends and/or the lid is closed, since that doesn't seem to be handled by the window manager, but rather systemd. If there are any articles on this or you have encountered this before, I'd be super thankful if you could give me a hand! Thanks in advance :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have a really annoying problem on my laptop where it sometimes runs out of battery without any warning and instantly shuts off. Then, when I boot it again, fsck fails and I am dropped into the emergency shell (the root account is locked so I have to boot an Arch liveusb and run fsck on the root partition). Is there any way to make fsck repair the corrupted filesystem automatically then boot like normal? I have set the root filesystem to be checked every mount: tune2fs -c 1 /dev/nvme0n1p2. The root filesystem is ext4 (64 bit) with fast_commit enabled.

 I've also checked rfkill list, Bluetooth is not blocked.
 I've recently installed a new wifi card Broadcomm BCM94360Z4 for hackintosh support. Bluetooth works fine in macOS and windows.
 I've posted in Arch Forums with no assistance. Please help.
