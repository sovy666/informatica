 Out of all of the filesystems I researched I couldn't pick if I should use XFS or ext4 for my home partition and if I should use XFS or ext4 for my root partition.
 I use my PC mainly for browsing the internets (4chan, yt, etc...)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm running into lighting/shadow visual glitches. So if anyone has run into something similar, knows how to fix this or knows what it can be, please comment below.
 In minecraft (using optifine), several different shaders seem to be running into different problems themselves. These striped shadows as shown in the screenshots appear in all of them and they only go away once i turn off every shadow related option to minimum.
 In Second Life (with Alchemy viewer) turning on Advanced Lighting Model has a similar effect, as you can see in pictures.
 I suspect is an OpenGL issue since both features previously mention make use of it.
 This visual glitch, however, is not present at all on games like Cyberpunk 2077, Metro Exodus EE, Elden Ring (all run with Proton Steam), and every GPU feature seem…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One day I was sitting back watching a video and suddenly the Bluetooth cut out. The built-in adapter was no longer detected. I soon came to figure out that after my computer boots, Bluetooth will not work unless I close the lid and re-open. It then works fine. At first, I assumed it was a hardware issue. I went as far as opening the laptop and reseating the module (which also handles Wi-Fi, which had no issues). I then learned that when it is in that state where it cannot detect the adapter, plugging in an external adapter also fails to be detected. Anyone heard of this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vi sarà certamente capitato, nell'esaminare le specifiche delle unità SSD in commercio, di imbattervi in dati che fotografano una situazione all'apparenza piuttosto strana: le unità a stato solido più capienti sono più veloci rispetto a quelli di dimensione inferiore.I dati non possono certo essere oggetto di discussione perché sono dichiarati dagli stessi produttori e riguardano modelli di SSD appartenenti alla medesima linea di prodotto (differiscono solamente per la rispettiva capienza).Certo, sappiamo bene che i dati pubblicati dai produttori spesso si discostano da quelli rilevati, in situazioni reali, da parte degli utenti. E quando si parla di SSD sono tante le tecnologie che rendono più veloci le unità a stato solido.Ma perché gli SSD sono più lenti se meno capienti?
Cosa significa IOPS
 Prendiamo in esame il valore IOPS nelle operazioni di lettura e scrittura random 4K delle unità SSD.IOPS, innanzi tutto, è acronimo di Input/Output Operations Per Second (si pronuncia eye-ops): si tratta di un valore che esprime il numero di operazioni che l'unità presa in esame è in grado di compiere in un secondo.Il valore di IOPS rilevato può comunque variare sulla base di molteplici fattori: la tipologia di operazioni di lettura e scrittura, il mix di modelli di accesso sequenziale e casuale, il numero di thread, la profondità della coda di lavoro, le dimensioni dei blocchi di dati, la configurazione del sistema, i driver, le operazioni svolte in background dal sistema operativo.Con la specifica IOPS viene data un'idea delle prestazioni di un SSD durante la lettura/scrittura dei dati random 4K posto che le performance di queste unità superano per ordini di grandezza quelle dei tradizionali hard disk magnetomeccanici.In un altro articolo abbiamo descritto le principali differenze tra hard disk e SSD.
Perché un SSD meno capiente è meno veloce?
 Abbiamo già rilevato come le unità SSD meno capienti siano dichiarate come meno prestazionali rispetto a quelle di maggiori dimensioni.]]></summary>

 However, in 2% of the times where I boot up my system, my second monitor is not being recognized.Running xrandr --listmonitors only shows my main display. Running xrandr | grep ' connected' also shows nothing but the main screen.
 The display also not recognized before logging in during SDDM.
 This issue can be solved many times by rebooting once, twice, ... n-times but it is annoying as I need a stable system.
 This issue also persisted across different "versions"; i am updating my system at least every two weeks.
 How can this be solved?
 P.S.: Although my account is a bit older, I don't have much experience with reddit. If there is anything to improve the question let me know. 
 EDIT: The second display is a bit older and takes some time to react when receiving new input. Is the issue, perhaps, that my system boots too fast?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As title states, I am having an issue with CJK characters in Chromium apps. They work perfectly fine in KDE apps such as panels and Dolphin, and Firefox renders them fine as well. However, Spotify, Discord, and Chromium all do not have font smoothing for these characters and they look ugly.
 Here is a comparison: https://i.imgur.com/xYUDY13.png
 Also, my related post on r/kde on this topic: https://old.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/v8wpuv/why_does_japanese_text_have_smoothing_and_looks/
 I figure if I can fix the fonts in Chromium, they should start working fine in Electron apps too.
 For the record, I have the following fonts installed on the system:
 noto-fonts-cjk
 adobe-source-han-sans-jp-fonts
 adobe-source-han-serif-jp-fonts
 otf-ipafont

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been playing around in NixOS for the last few days and I really like the concept of a config file handling everything that you have on your computer to the point where if you take that one file and install NixOS on another computer with that config file, everything that's on the other computer will be on the new computer. Sort of like duplicating the system.
 Is there a way to do this with Arch (or any other distro for that matter)? I'm sure that feature is built into NixOS but is there a program to install during a basic Arch installation that will use a config file to install all of your needed packages? I know a script will do it but it's kind of neat having a config file that sets up your network, desktop environment, time, etc as well as install all of your programs.

L'idea era quella di mettere a punto un sistema che tutti potessero utilizzare, per rendere l'informatica più popolare e proporre un'interfaccia user-friendly.I due riuscirono nell'intento se si considera che il successo commerciale fu enorme per quei tempi con più di 5 milioni di esemplari complessivamente venduti.Il modello originale poggiava il suo funzionamento su una CPU MOS 6502 a 1 MHz, offriva una grafica a colori, con una matrice del testo pari a 40 x 24 caratteri, uscita video composita, interfaccia a cassetta per l'archiviazione e otto slot di espansione interni.Veniva venduto in configurazioni variabili che andavano da 1.298 dollari con una dotazione di 4 KB di RAM a 2.638 dollari per 48 KB di RAM.]]></summary>

But when a file have a Chinese name, it can't show this name, it shows blank or long string of numbers with /\"", something like that.
 For example, if I open the terminal, change ibus to Chinese and type, I got something like this:
 [user@mypc ~]$ 你 好 
 But if there's a file name 你 好.doc and I use ls command to list it or use ranger to navigate the file, it will show like this:
 [user@mypc ~]$ ls file.txt " .doc" 
 or sometime like this (I guess it depends on specific characters):
 [user@mypc ~]$ ls file.txt "123/60/4646/"4875/'.doc" (<--I made it up but it kind of look like this) 
 While I expect to see:
 [user@mypc ~]$ ls file.txt "你 好.doc" 
 I've already put a Chinese font to /usr/local/share/fonts. I also un-comment zh_cn in locale. Only in terminal it behaves like this. If I use a GUI file manager, it looks fine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I encounter a bug in some Arch package, from time to time I do my part and try to track it down by taking the Arch PKGBUILD, compiling the code, flipping compile-time options, or modifying the source code, and generally just finding out why the code is not behaving as it should. Sometimes the problem is upstream, and I report it there, and it usually gets fixed. Sometimes the problem is not upstream, but in the actual Arch packaging.
 Note that I'm 1000% ready to give the Arch maintainers benefit of doubt: my assumption is that they are busy and overworked, like all of us are, and have lives to live outside of fixing Arch packaging bugs, like all of us do. Still, it's pretty frustrating to spend time -- it takes a few hours usually -- to diagnose a bug and propose a fix, and to see the bug just sitting there for months on end. 
 So my question is, is the Arch project thinking about scaling up its efforts? As an example, for one bug I reported, I see the maintainer is maintaining 750+ packages. Another question I have is, what can we as users do to help speed up the process?
 I for one am hoping that one day we can have our PKGBUILDs in Git repositories, and that lowly peanut gallery members like myself can send pull requests to package maintainers, who then have to do not much more than reviewing the proposed changes, and merging them. This would still not work that well for someone who is maintaining 750+ packages, but at least it's less work than also fiddling with the PKGBUILDs and patches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I'm new to AWS and currently learning it. I've come to find that the version in the official Arch repositories is still on the major version 1 instead of 2, while AWS CLI v2 has been released in early 2020.
 I've looked up online and found what I believe is the most likely reason why, namely the fact that Amazon refuses to publish a package to PyPI for v2.
 And this is totally understandable that maintainers would initially want to keep using the tried and tested version for a while. However it's two years later now and being capped to v1 makes users miss all new features (because v1 is apparently only receiving bugfixes until it dies), among those really important ones like SSO. Considering AWS is the biggest cloud provider around, I would venture to say providing the v2 at least in an another named package (in order to keep offering v1 too) is very important for the Arch community.
 Yes there's an AUR package but this kind of program clearly qualifies as official repo material to me, considering its sheer number of users, its power and thus dangerousness. 
 Has there been a discussion about it ?

Early Reports of Unsupported PCs Getting Upgrade

Il miglioramento complessivo in termini di performance per core sarà del 15% come peraltro già precedentemente indicato tenendo conto che il balzo in avanti sarà riconducibile alle frequenze operative più elevate dei processori realizzati con un processo litografico a 5 nm.Le prestazioni in multi core aumenteranno di circa il 35% nel caso del Ryzen 7000 a 16 core, il potenziale Ryzen 9 7950X.Ci sarà comunque un miglioramento marcato sul piano delle prestazioni per watt: in questo caso si parla di un +25%.I tecnici di AMD aggiungono che la larghezza di banda della memoria aumenterà fino al 125% rispetto a Zen 3, il che potrebbe essere un'ulteriore conferma dell'utilizzo di DDR5 fino a 7200 MHz.Celebrando i primi 5 anni dei processori Ryzen a marzo di quest'anno, AMD aveva fatto qualche piccola rivelazione sui suoi piani futuri.]]></summary>

 I live on the property of a retirement since I’m a minor and live with a parent who works on the property. Sometimes we’ll be given random stuff that’s left behind by residents who have passed and didn’t have anyone to claim their items. 
 This time it was an asus computer running arch Linux and I’m very curious as to what could be on this device, but there’s a zenbook login and password needed. Is there anyway I can bypass this?
 The screen is all black and the only test is up in the upper left corner;

 i don't have old packages in cache cause reinstalled arch so just wanted to know if i download package from that site and then run "pacman -U filename.tar.zst" will it perform same checks as installing from the official repo, when i installed it ran these checks (1/1) checking keys in keyring, (1/1) checking package integrity. 
 also, what are the chances of getting a malicious package and how to avoid getting one? and what if you get one?

It makes you feel like you’re right there in the middle of it. If you’ve been considering getting one, this may be the deal you’ve been waiting for. For 43% off, you can get a Sceptre Curved 24″ LED Monitor with 98% sRGB, HDMI, VGA, and built-in speakers.
    
The anti-flicker in the monitor will allow you to see a sharper picture, as it won’t allow the backlight that you would otherwise occasionally get from flickering. The 75Hz Refresh Rate is more than the industry standard and helps gamers with visibility. There are no blurry images, as frames transition instantly.
   
 
   
The curved display in the Sceptre Curved 24″ LED Monitor has a 1500R screen curvature to envelop you in your favorite streamed movies and TV shows. Tilt the screen 15 degrees backward and 5 degrees forward to get the optimum angle for you, leading to more comfortability.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an Arch desktop PC with X11+KDE Plasma and I'd like to switch it to Wayland, mostly for security reasons. I installed what is suggested on the wiki. On my laptop I never installed X11 and sddm nicely offers a Wayland+KDE session, so on my desktop I had expected sddm to let me select either X11 or Wayland, now that both are installed. Still X11 is all that is offered.
 sddm log just says running /usr/bin/X but doesn't tell me why.
 Does anyone know what I am missing here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I’ve been running an install of arch with xmonad on my spare SSD for a while now and I’m looking to make the full switch. Literally the only thing holding me back is how well the unity game engine runs on arch Linux (I prefer engineless programming but I’m working on a partnered project in which the scope demands that I use it). I know that Ubuntu and Debian are (apparently) fully supported, but I would prefer to use something arch based. Can anyone vouch for its stability and performance on arch?

 I was wondering if anyone have any idea on this. Would this be a bug or do I miss something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings Arch Community,
 I've been running Gnome for a couple releases now (since ~3.30), and while performance improves with each new release, which I'm always very grateful for, it always feels like there is still room for some improvement. There can be the occasional lag/stutter with animations, like going in/out of Overview mode or going in/out of the App Drawer for example. This is noticeable not just on Arch, but on other distros I've tested like Fedora, PopOS, Solus, etc, so it's not unique to just Arch, but more so to the Gnome DE and quite possibly my hardware too. 
 I have an Acer Aspire E5-576G laptop, which has an Nvidia MX150/Intel hybrid setup, currently setup with EnvyControl, using the latest nvidia-dkms driver, to use the Nvidia GPU as the primary since I'm always connected to a power source. Since it's Nvidia, I still need to use Xorg for a majority of my workflow. I do like to test out Wayland every so often, but my default still needs to be Xorg for now.
 I'm currently using mutter v42.2-1 as my window manager, but I've noticed there are two other options available in the AUR: mutter-performance and mutter-dynamic-buffering
 I'm curious if these packages could offer any significantly noticeable improvement(s) under Xorg or if the gains are negligible under Xorg. 
 I'm wondering for any other Nvidia and/or Xorg users out there that have tried either of these two AUR packages, how your experience has been and if you recommend one package over the other for any reason(s)? Would appreciate any feedback so I have an idea what to expect before I can test them out. My understanding is it looks like the patches work better under Wayland than Xorg, so I appreciate any comments from others that have already tried either of these patches, thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Friends.
 I have tweaked the efly live system to facilitate persistent storage, so that changes are kept after rebooting.
 You can change keymap, timezone, language etc. and don't have to retype everything, when you decide to reboot. Everything stays.
 Installing packages and creating files is also possible without problems. The system will auto-expand at boot to the size of your stick. Usage as a hybrid rescue system / portable storage is possible.
 Creating the disk image yourself is very easy, if you are running an Arch Linux system. How to do that is explained on github.
 This is how you can place it on a stick:
  wget https://github.com/flying-dude/efly/releases/download/latest/efly-live.img sudo cp efly-live.img /dev/sdX # replace sdX with the device node of your stick 
 If you want to run it inside a VM, you need to truncate first:
  wget https://github.com/flying-dude/efly/releases/download/latest/efly-live.img truncate --size=10G efly-live.img git clone https://github.com/flying-dude/efly efly/scripts/efly-qemu --uefi efly-live.img 
 This is brand-new but so far it works really well. Let me know, if you are encountering issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I only have one hard drive for my tower computer. I don't really want to buy another hard drive since I don't really use windows at all when I dual boot. I would like to have pure arch linux on the same drive but I've heard its not a good idea, which is strange because by that logic all laptop users shouldnt dual boot windows and linux. I guess it's safer if you never really use windows since windows has a lot of updates here and there? I never really use windows anyways. Right now I am dual booting windows and pop os on my tower and everything works fine. Just want to know if I can expect the same result with arch (assuming I do the long installation process correctly). Any tips on making installing arch linux an easier experience would be appreciated as well.

 There appear to be two versions of fsck.exfat in the repos, one in exfatprogs and one in exfat-utils. Neither version will agree to repair the errors. The one in exfat-utils finds 33 errors on the device, but no matter what flags I give it it won't attempt to repair them.
 The version in exfatprogs only finds two errors, but it automatically answers all the repair questions as "no", even if I pass the -p -r, or -y flags.
 In both cases, I tried running as root and as a regular user.
 The man page says nothing helpful here, anyone know what might be up?
