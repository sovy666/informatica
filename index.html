                              <span>Fairly recently switched from ubuntu-based distros to arch-based and a main reason was the package management. Now that I am here I am having a bit of issues with the workflow. Is there any good information about efficient ways to search for and install packages?
 Either the terminal or a GUI works fine if I want to install a single, specific package. Otherwise I find it pretty frustrating and slow. 
 I have repeatedly read advice that it&#x27;s better to use the terminal but how do you do this without endless copy and pasting? With a GUI you can click click click to select what is desired. In the terminal it is very cumbersome. It&#x27;s hard to read a list of dozens of results on the terminal. 
 However both pamac-manager and especially octopi GUI package managers have a big problem which is that if you select multiple packages for install and there is a problem with any of them, the whole job fails. It&#x27;s hard to figure out where the problem is. 
 Also would like to learn about the different variations of the same package that are usually available and why I would choose one or the other. Is there a way to specify a preference? I have found that accidentally mixing them causes dependency issues. 
 I would appreciate any advice or links to reading on the subject. The documentation for the package manager and related tools themselves do not seem really to contain this kind of information and not sure how or where to look.

 I have followed multiple tutorials on reinstalling the boot loader like the one below:
 example tutorial
 However no matter what I pick to boot for my computer hangs on loading initial ramdisk. 
 I have tried to remove quiet and increase the log level to 7 but both reveal nothing new… 
 Any help with this is greatly appreciated

                              <span>When social media giant Facebook (now Meta) purchased everyone’s favorite mobile messaging app WhatsApp, users were promised their data would be private and that they wouldn’t be subject to the shady things that Mark Zuckerberg and crew are known for. As time has gone on, more and more privacy has been taken away from Whatsapp users in the name of “analytical data.” 
    
Gone are the days when you could trust this app to be totally private and not expect to get data mined for valuable information – information that could easily be sold to advertisers. Here we show you the best alternatives to WhatsApp that actually respect your privacy.

                              <span>Hello guys. I am new here :D So I am trying to install arch on my laptop and everything is more or less straightforward except disk partition part, because I have two partitions on my nwme drive. One is being used by windows 11 another is for linux. So I have used ubuntu/ mint before, and I had really no problem installing them, but arc is fucking with my newb brain. Anyway first I have tried to do old fashioned comand line install and I have made partitions( boot/swap/file system) on /dev/nvme0n1p5(p1/p2/p3)but when I wanted to format them on the next step with the command, it would come back as partition is not existing. Ok, so then I used script to install, which also does not show partitions i created before. It shows there is free space but in selection it shows nothing. I booted back to windows just to format that unpartitioned space to exfat so I know which partition i need to work with, but this is where I left confused. Do i need to delete this partition? Should i split it in 3 partitions again for boot, swap and file system for arch or should i create just one and script will do the rest? I really dont want to delete all my partitions accidentally so I am asking for little help. Thanks 🙏

                              <span>Title pretty much says it all. I was curious what people&#x27;s experience with Arch as a server OS has been and what&#x27;s it running? 
 I&#x27;ve been thinking of installing something like a LAMP stack on an Arch server and fixing it when it (inevitably?) breaks to hone my Linux admin skills.

 EDIT: I&#x27;ve look at the arch forum people there are having similar issues

 Edit again: I temporary blacklisted the pcspkr module so the beeping goes away till a solution is found

sbctl create-keys
 sbctl enroll-keys
  
Rebooted.
 Now the computer is bricked, I can&#x27;t do anything there because the UEFI screen simply doesn&#x27;t appear. My BIOS is a Gigabyte B550 which has Q-Flash Plus but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well... Any ideas?
 To be honest, the documentation of the tool should warn you that even the two first steps can brick your BIOS.

I can&#x27;t work with this because I&#x27;m colorblind - I have to remove any boldface color from my system. Is this possible with pacman? Or is my only recourse to disable color output?

 Already checked in alsamixer, and nothing is muted or at 0.
 Also i&#x27;ve tried to capture my voice, but I only get noise using this cmd:

 Can someone tell me what I&#x27;m missing ?

                              <span>This is output from pacman.log that shows java 17 getting installed but I&#x27;m not sure why. I install jre11-openjdk before https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/datagrip (with yay) since it&#x27;s a dependency, then I install https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/elasticsearch7 which has jre11-openjdk-headless as a dependency.
 I&#x27;m not running pacman -S --noconfirm --config /etc/pacman.conf -- extra/jre17-openjdk-headless extra/jre17-openjdk extra/java-environment-common extra/jdk17-openjdk myself so what is doing it? Is it coming from a dependency? I looked in PKGBUILD for these packages but couldn&#x27;t see anything that explains why it&#x27;s there or how I can stop it from getting installed.

This is fixed by going into the gnome settings and switching to a different sound device then back to the original sound device that I wanted to use. I don’t have this issue on my other devices running arch (but don’t run gnome), anyone have any idea what this is caused by or his to fix it?

                              <span>Hello,
 I have webcam called &quot;Logitech QuickCam Chat&quot; and when I try to run Cheese it doesn&#x27;t detect it.
 When I run lsusb I see it:
 Bus 003 Device 010: ID 046d:092e Logitech, Inc. QuickCam Chat 
 even when I run v4l2-ctl --list-devices I see:
 Camera (usb-0000:00:14.0-4.4): /dev/video0 
 What can be problem that it doesn&#x27;t work?

zathura wid: 0x2400003
 tabbed wid: 0x2000002
 root wid: 0x716
  
When i start zathura like this and then reparent to the tabbed instance and then reparent again to the root window everything works as expected.
 zathura bash.pdf xdotool windowreparent 0x2000003 0x2000002 xdotool windowreparent 0x2000003 0x716 
 When i however use the -e,--reparent&#x3D;xid option for zathura to immediately launch the window into the tabbed instance and then reparent to the root window, the zathura window simply disappears and the zathura process stops.
 zathura bash.pdf -e 0x2000002 xdotool windowreparent 0x2000003 0x716 
 (i use the berry window manager in case that helps)

                              <span>Hi.
 This is not a complain, I&#x27;m just curious why the Wine package hasn&#x27;t being updated yet. Its falling behind two versions already. I&#x27;m quite new to Arch, so I don&#x27;t know if its normal this delay or something else?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Did anybody meet the problem, when the GNOME&#x27;s volume control does not follow the system default sound input/output?
 This problem first came out after I changed to Pipewire, from PulseAudio. In arch docs I did not found any suggestions for this problem.
 I.e.: I change the default sound input/output to a bluetooth headset and I would mute my mic w/ the system&#x27;s shortcut but it mutes the analog input.

                              <span>I have a bunch of encrypted drivers and it&#x27;s taking forever to boot, because systemd-automount is preparing the drives. I was thinking of creating a systemd-timer that mount all drives as soon as I reached the GUI. This way my system would boot relatively fast and is usable immediately while the drives are unlocked using keyfiles and mounted in the background.
 Is this a practical solution or am I overthinking it?

 I imported my .ovpn file to networkmanager-openvpn using nmcli connection import type openvpn file /etc/openvpn/client/vpn.opvn.
 The vpn.ovpn contains
 route-nopull route 192.168.178.10 255.255.255.0 
 (demo ip used).
 Connection can be established and so on, but all of my traffic is routed through the vpn.
 If I establish connection using sudo /usr/sbin/openvpn /etc/openvpn/client/vpn.opvn everything is working fine.
 Any ideas so far?

It is also written in the TPM arch wiki page but following the instructions doesn&#x27;t work for me, in fact it doesn&#x27;t work anymore to unlock via TPM2 because it asks me for the passphrase.

                              <span>Don’t let the name “Pretty Good Privacy” mislead you. PGP encryption is the gold standard for encrypted communication and has been used by everyone from nuclear activists to criminals since its invention in 1991. While the execution is complex, the concept is simple: you can encrypt text, making it unreadable to anyone who doesn’t have the key to decode it.

Wouldn’t it be helpful to have a voice assistant in your car to help with appointments, shopping lists, and directions? You can get an Amazon Echo Auto with Alexa for under $20. You have to admit that’s a deal that’s hard to pass up.
    
The small device connects to the Alexa app on your phone using your car’s speakers via auxiliary input or a Bluetooth connection with your phone. It connects to your car via a vent mount. Amazon created it specifically to add convenience to your car trips, employing eight microphones and far-field technology to allow it to hear you over the traffic, your music, air conditioning, etc.
    

    
Your boredom with the same local radio stations ends here. You can control the Amazon Echo Auto through the Alexa app on your phone and ask it to stream Amazon Music, Apple Music, Spotify, SiriusXM, Audible, and radio stations via TuneIn and iHeartRadio. Catch up on your favorite podcasts and be fully entertained.

The thing is, they’re notoriously hard on battery life while gaming. While you’re not likely to get much game time playing the same way you do while plugged into the wall, there are some things you can do to make gaming, when you don’t have an outlet handy, last longer than 15 minutes.

                              <span>Being human means that we’re prone to forgetting. Fortunately, with the help of technology, it’s easy to stay on top of our to-do lists with minimal effort. One of the most convenient ways to remember everything on your list of chores is to set location-based reminders. Need to be reminded to call your great aunt on her birthday? You can instruct your phone to send an alert once you’ve made it to your favorite cafe for your lunch break. Creating location-based reminders like these is simple if you have an Android device, and this article looks at all the options for doing that.

                              <span>Correva l&#x27;anno 2016 quando Microsoft e Qualcomm annunciarono la loro partnership incentrata su Windows on ARM.Da allora la &#x27;maturazione&#x27; di Windows sulla piattaforma ARM è stata piuttosto lenta: basti pensare che soltanto l&#x27;anno scorso Windows 11 on ARM ha aggiunto il supporto per le applicazioni x64 grazie all&#x27;emulazione gettando un ponte con le tradizionali installazioni del sistema operativo effettuate su sistemi basati su processore Intel o AMD.In occasione della conferenza Microsoft Build 2022, l&#x27;azienda di Redmond ha annunciato un kit di sviluppo chiamato Project Volterra.Project Volterra è una sorta di mini PC basato su SoC Qualcomm Snapdragon che permetterà agli sviluppatori di realizzare e provare le applicazioni ARM per Windows su hardware reale.Si tratta di un&#x27;importante pietra miliare con cui Microsoft conferma di nuovo la sua volontà di investire su Windows on ARM.</span>

                              <span>Approvato a febbraio 2021, WiFi 6 è uno dei più recenti standard per le comunicazioni senza fili. In un altro articolo abbiamo visto cos&#x27;è WiFi 6 e se è davvero indispensabile.Lo standard WiFi 6 in sé è conosciuto anche come 802.11 ax: tant&#x27;è vero che i router con la sigla AX nel nome del modello sono appunto quelli compatibili.Abbiamo visto il significato delle sigle dei router oggi in commercio.Per le connessioni in fibra ottica non è necessario usare un router WiFi 6, almeno non a stretto rigore. In via puramente teorica WiFi 6 consente di raggiungere 9,6 Gbps di banda ma all&#x27;atto pratico un router WiFi 6 di medio livello potrebbe essere decisamente meno performante rispetto a un dispositivo WiFi 5 di alto profilo.Nel migliore dei casi un router WiFi 6 utilizzato con un client WiFi 6 2x2 può consentire il trasferimento dati in modalità wireless a 1 Gbps.</span>

                              <span>Nel corso di decenni Microsoft non ha mai rilasciato una sua applicazione per recuperare file cancellati. L&#x27;ha fatto a giugno 2020 pubblicando sul suo store Windows File Recovery, programma gratuito che facilita il recupero dati su hard disk tradizionali, unità SSD e altri dispositivi di memorizzazione quali schede SD e memorie flash.Il software è scaricabile dal Microsoft Store: basta cliccare sul pulsante Ottieni in alto a destra quindi su Installa e poi su Avvia.

Pur essendo prelevabile dal Microsoft Store, Windows File Recovery attualmente non dispone di un&#x27;interfaccia grafica e funziona dal prompt dei comandi.Cliccando il pulsante il pulsante Avvia o selezionando la voce Windows File Recovery dal menu Start di Windows 10, comparirà una schermata simile a quella riprodotta in figura con l&#x27;elenco di tutti i comandi utilizzabili.

È facile ipotizzare che Microsoft stia lavorando anche sull&#x27;interfaccia grafica di Windows File Recovery perché nella cartella d&#x27;installazione si trova un file eseguibile ospitato all&#x27;interno di una cartella con il nome GUI.Lo strumento Microsoft è un&#x27;ottima soluzione per recuperare file importanti anche da supporti formattati oppure danneggiati.</span>

                              <span>Qualche tempo fa vi avevamo parlato del progetto di NVidia la cui intelligenza artificiale generava immagini fotorealistiche partendo da semplici descrizioni. Il lavoro svolto dai tecnici di NVidia, che hanno addestrato una rete neurale per produrre immagini di qualità quanto più vicine alla descrizione fornita dagli utenti, è stato poi integrato anche in NVidia Canvas per creare foto a partire da disegni e schizzi elementari.Anche il team di Microsoft-OpenAI ha sviluppato una soluzione (DALL-E 2) che crea immagini a partire da descrizioni testuali ma Google, nel frattempo, ha presentato il progetto Imagen mostrando un ricco assaggio dei risultati ottenibili.Visitando il sito del progetto ci si accorge subito di come le immagini di qualità vengano create a partire anche da descrizioni piuttosto articolate o addirittura bizzarre.Il sistema unisce due strumenti che nell&#x27;ultimo periodo hanno fatto segnare enormi passi in avanti: da un lato ci sono le tecniche di imaging basate sull&#x27;intelligenza artificiale che compongono e perfezionano per passi successivi le immagini effettuando una valutazione in tempo reale sulla resa finale.Dall&#x27;altro lato c&#x27;è la comprensione della semantica ovvero del significato intrinseco di parole e frasi attraverso modelli linguistici di grandi dimensioni.

Google Imagen inizia generando un&#x27;immagine piccola (64 x 64 pixel) e quindi esegue due passaggi di &#x27;super risoluzione&#x27; per portarla a 1024 x 1024 pixel.</span>

                              <span>Con la pubblicazione di una nota sul blog dell&#x27;azienda, Microsoft ha confermato che lo sviluppo di Windows 10 prosegue. La versione di riferimento del sistema operativo, che sarà supportato fino al 14 ottobre 2025, è al momento Windows 10 21H2 ovvero il feature update rilasciato pubblicamente a metà novembre 2021. In autunno verrà pubblicato l&#x27;aggiornamento 22H2.Come spiega Microsoft, gli iscritti al programma Windows Insider riceveranno in anteprima un importante aggiornamento (KB5014023) che quasi sicuramente verrà rilasciato per tutti nel corso del mese di giugno.L&#x27;aggiornamento risolve innanzi tutto un problema nella copia dei file che in alcune situazioni può apparire lenta. Fast Copy, TeraCopy, UltraCopier o lo stesso comando Robocopy sono ottime alternative alla copia con Esplora file ovvero con l&#x27;interfaccia di Windows 10.</span>

Questo può capitare per diverse ragioni: perché una qualche app sta usando il processore in modo massiccio o perché siamo vittime di qualche malfunzionamento interno.

 Non va sottovalutato anche il lasciare il telefono al sole in una giornata...

                              <span>Many leading news websites nowadays come with paywalls. To read more than two or three articles on such websites, you have to pay for a subscription. If you need occasional access to a publication’s website, it doesn’t make sense to subscribe to all of them. Also, the limited free content available might not be enough to evaluate whether a subscription is worth paying for. In such cases, it helps to know how to bypass the news sites’ restrictive paywalls.

                              <span>If you’re getting tired of answering the door every time your doorbell rings, only to find it was either a solicitor or yet another package being delivered, you need a Ring Video Doorbell Wired. This device will replace your existing doorbell while recording footage of visitors and alerting you to people on your doorstep or motion in the area.
    
The Ring has two-way talk, advanced motion detection, customizable settings, and connects via 2.4 GHz. Real-time notifications will be sent directly to your phone. If you connect an Echo device, you can get notifications there as well. As the Ring won’t play your existing doorbell sound, connect a Chime to hear it or rely on hearing a doorbell sound through your phone or Echo device.
    

    
Advanced motion detection will alert you to someone on your doorstep before they hit the Ring Video Doorbell. Talk to them by turning on the mic in the app on your phone or by telling Alexa to “talk to the front door.” The camera has night... Read more</span>

                              <span>Git is a brilliant tool. It simplifies the version control process and it allows users to easily share and contribute code to each other. Git is also system and content agnostic. This means that it can run on any platform, which makes it a highly useful and sought after tool for programmers and casual users alike.
    
One issue with Git, however, is that it requires you to use a command-line utility to fully use its functions. This means that in order to use Git you need to learn a number of commands specific to it. However, if you are using Emacs there can be a better way.
    
Magit is a powerful front-end for Git in Emacs. It allows you to easily and seamlessly use Git in Emacs to create, manipulate and save Git repositories through simple Emacs keybindings. Not only that, Magit also automatically adapts existing Git repositories through its interface. This means that you can install Magit right now and immediately use it to manage version control.

                              <span>Hi 
 After the recent KDE plasma update i think 2 or three days ago, the KDE Menu aka Launcher and Kicker pannel is very slow. That means if i click it nothing happens for like 5-8 seconds. Then it behaves as it should a a click is a click etc. But very slow. However rest of the System and KDE Apps like dolphin work normal. Just the pannel and plasma menu are slow as hell.
 Composite effects are already off.
 Any ideas ?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I have a script set up that calls systemctl suspend after detecting that I&#x27;m idle. However, I noticed that my internet connection wouldn&#x27;t functon for a little while after waking the computer up. So I tested it with a shell script:
 #!/bin/bash begin&#x3D;$(date +%s%N) while true do if ping -q -w 1 -c 1 &#x60;ip r | grep default | cut -d &#x27; &#x27; -f 3&#x60; &amp;&gt; /dev/null ; then break else finaltime&#x3D;$(($(date +%s%N) - begin)) fi done echo $((finaltime/1000000)) 
 This basically gives me the amount of time the system had no internet connection in milliseconds. I average around 15500 ms, so around 16s after wake, which I find annoying. I tried to fix this with a service in systemd, but restaring networkmanager or playing around with r8169 didn&#x27;t work.
 Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

 It used to be about half as tilted before the update. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s yet another fontconfig update overwriting my configs and messing things up for no good reason, but I really just want to solve this issue. Is there a better way to solve this than to revert to a backup of /etc/fonts/?

                              <span>Coming from KDE, I never had an issue with this. But I am currently in a WM setup and the xfce power manager seems to completely miss the fact that I have videos playing inside my browser and turns off the screen assuming inactivity.
 After doing some searching online, I came across this answer on stackexchange
 Following is the script suggested by a user on this thread. The only problem being it seems to be a script for a gnome setup.
 #!/bin/bash # Cleanup any bad state we left behind if the user exited while flash was # running gconftool-2 -s /apps/gnome-screensaver/idle_activation_enabled --type bool true we_turned_it_off&#x3D;0 while true; do sleep 60 flash_on&#x3D;0 for pid in &#x60;pgrep firefox&#x60; ; do if grep libflashplayer /proc/$pid/maps &gt; /dev/null ; then flash_on&#x3D;1 fi ss_on&#x3D;&#x60;gconftool-2 -g /apps/gnome-screensaver/idle_activation_enabled&#x60; if [ &quot;$flash_on&quot; &#x3D; &quot;1&quot; ] &amp;&amp; [ &quot;$ss_on&quot; &#x3D; &quot;true&quot; ]; then gconftool-2 -s /apps/gnome-screensaver/idle_activation_enabled \ --type bool false we_turned_it_off&#x3D;1 elif [ &quot;$flash_on&quot; &#x3D; &quot;0&quot; ] &amp;&amp; [ &quot;$ss_on&quot; &#x3D; &quot;false&quot; ] \ &amp;&amp; [ &quot;$we_turned_it_off&quot; &#x3D; &quot;1&quot; ]; then gconftool-2 -s /apps/gnome-screensaver/idle_activation_enabled \ --type bool true we_turned_it_off&#x3D;0 fi done done 
 Could I possibly have a xdg-screensaver equivalent written for my system? I know its probably possible but I am unable to wrap my head around it. Any help/guidance in the right direction is highly appreciated.
 To be clear, I am not looking for a manual solution like activating presentation mode from the terminal/using caffeine (which would only work if the apps are in full screen).

                              <span>I would describe it as a low hum with a pop/tick overtop at regular intervals. I&#x27;m using pipewire currently, but It was still an issue when I used pulseaudio. This is only an issue with direct input via the 3.5mm jack, it doesn&#x27;t happen over bluetooth. It starts, regularly, about 5 seconds after I end playback. The hum amplifies when I touch parts of the speaker&#x27;s metal chassis, which makes me worried there&#x27;s a grounding issue.
 This person seems to have had the same issue, but the guide they say (partially) fixed it links to a website with an expired certificate.

                              <span>Chi ha vissuto l&#x27;informatica negli anni &#x27;90 certamente si ricorderà degli storici processori Mendocino di Intel immessi sul mercato nel 1998. Erano CPU Celeron che risultavano interessanti per le buone opportunità offerte agli appassionati di overclocking.Adesso anche AMD sceglie il nome Mendocino (si ispira a quello di una contea californiana, negli Stati Uniti) e lo fa per le sue nuove APU destinate ai notebook più efficienti ed economici. La conferma arriva all&#x27;apertura dei battenti del Computex 2022 di Taipei.I nuovi AMD Ryzen Mendocino sembrano piuttosto simili all&#x27;APU personalizzata Aerith che la società di Sunnyvale ha sviluppato per la console portatile Steam Deck di Valve.Mendocino includerà CPU, GPU e controller di memoria nello stesso pacchetto e sarà prodotta da TSMC su un moderno processo produttivo a 6 nm.AMD ha scelto in questo caso di utilizzare l&#x27;architettura Zen 2 e non la più aggiornata Zen 3 per motivi di costi e consumi proponendo modelli con 4 core fisici e 8 thread.Punto nodale è sicuramente la sezione grafica: AMD l&#x27;ha migliorata rispetto alle precedenti APU con grafica integrata basata su architettura RDNA2.Mendocino supporterà inoltre memorie LPDDR5 nelle configurazioni con bus di memoria a due (64 bit) o ​​quattro canali (128 bit).Il resto delle sue funzionalità di I/O, connettività e ottimizzazione dell&#x27;alimentazione sono le stesse utilizzate nella serie Ryzen 6000.

In termini di durata della batteria, AMD assicura che i computer basati su chip Mendocino potranno essere utilizzati per almeno 10 ore prima di necessitare di una ricarica.I primi sistemi basati su Ryzen Mendocino arriveranno sul mercato prima di Natale e si sa già che a utilizzarli saranno ad esempio i laptop Lenovo IdeaPad 1.I portatili equipaggiati con le APU Mendocino di AMD costeranno tra 399 e 699 euro e supporteranno sia Windows che Chrome OS.
Processori desktop AMD Ryzen 7000 e socket AM5
 Al Computex 2022 ampio spazio è stato riservato per la gamma di processori desktop AMD Ryzen 7000.</span>
