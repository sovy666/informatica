Now when I try to boot it says A start job is running for /dev/mmcblk0p1 after which it says Timed out waiting for device /dev/mmcblk0p1 and goes into emergency mode and says Cannot open access to console, the root account is locked. How do I fix this?
 Edit: I restored a time shift backup and now I get Failed to mount /boot. when booting Is my system even recoverable?
 Edit: I&#x27;m on a Thinkpad and I&#x27;m pretty mmcblk0p1 refers to a partition on an SD card, so I&#x27;m not sure why that&#x27;s even referenced at boot.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m a new Arch user (and pretty much new Linux user) and I&#x27;m currently going through the process of installing Arch as a dual-boot option. I&#x27;m not here to discuss why I&#x27;m doing that in the first place, as it&#x27;s kind of a long story.
 I have the Arch ISO on a bootable USB drive and have successfully booted into it. However, the Windows user in me came out and I completely forgot about my WiFi USB adapter and that I have no drivers for it. There is no wired internet in my apartment, and I don&#x27;t have access to the router, so a wired connection is not an option.
 The drivers for my chipset can be found on the AUR. I&#x27;ve spent the last few hours trying to compile the package on a VM on my laptop and transfer it to my PC via USB, but I keep running into increasingly frustrating issues and gave up.
 I&#x27;m fairly new to Linux and am in over my head, so I came to the experts: what do you think would be the easiest way to install these drivers? I still have full access to Windows (where I&#x27;m typing this), so I was wondering if there was a way to install them directly using File Explorer, but, again, I have very little idea what I&#x27;m talking about. Any advice at all would be very much appreciated.
 Thank you for your time.
 EDIT: more information
 I have attempted to use the adapter as-is to no avail. Using dmesg -W and plugging it in outputs:
 usb 3-3: new high-speed USB device number 6 using xhci_hcd usb 3-3: new USB device found, idVendor&#x3D;0b05, idProduct&#x3D;184c, bcdDevice&#x3D; 2.10 usb 3-3: new USB device strings: Mfr&#x3D;1, Product&#x3D;2, SerialNumber&#x3D;3 usb 3-3: Product: 802.11ac NIC usb 3-3: Manufacturer: RealTek usb 3-3: SerialNumber: 123456 
 It is also listed when lsusb is used. I&#x27;ve tried restarting iwd as suggested by almost every forum post with this issue, but the device and adapter lists remain empty after all permutations of the process.

                              <span>I am casual gamer on Stadia and notice by default Hardware VP9 was not enabled which was also absent for YouTube videos. I followed Arch Linux wiki to enable Guc/HuC and GPU HAL in my system and chromium (with vaapi patch) and Firefox. After I did that the video played in Chromium would process with hardware decoding but it was intermittently freezing/blacking out especially if I opened developer pane view and then resumed if I maximized video. On Firefox, the video playback was stable but suffered with lower FFPs performance. In both scenarios intel_gpu_top showed no more than 3% of video usage. This was my experience with video playback in 2K (1440p). Overall its pretty disappointing and now I ran chromium without HAL flags unless I play Stadia.

                              <span>Hi guys, I have been dealing with a strange issue today.
 I would like to check out KDE Connect, and a required step is to allow port range 1714:1764 UDP and TCP to pair with the device. https://userbase.kde.org/KDEConnect#I_have_two_devices_running_KDE_Connect_on_the_same_network.2C_but_they_can.27t_see_each_other
 Sadly, both me doing the rule manually from the shell, or using a gui for ufw, will fail with the following:
 ERROR: problem running ufw-initWarning: Extension multiport revision 0 not supported, missing kernel module?iptables-restore v1.8.8 (legacy): invalid port/service \1714:1764&#x27; specifiedError occurred at line: 19
 I have been trying to search for this error, or for a missing package to install to allow iptables to function correctly in this regard, but failed.
 Do anybody of you have a hint for me how to get this module running?
 Is this a known issue or a misconfiguration on my side somewhere?
 Thanks

                              <span>I recently installed Arch, but I noticed that I was unable to see any wireless access points with iwctl. Someone suggested that I may need linux-firmware, so I used my installation medium and arch-chroot to grab it. I also did a pacman -Syu. Now, when I try to boot into the OS after decrypting my partition, I see [FAILED] Failed to start Load Kernel Modules. and several instances of [FAILED] Failed to start Wireless services. before proceeding to the login screen. I can still login, but when I tried to launch iwctl, I got stuck on &quot;waiting for IWD to respond,&quot; so clearly I broke something.
 I did some googling, and it seems that this can be caused by an unmounted /boot, but if I am understanding the output of lsblk -f correctly, then mine is mounted. I could also see /boot in my fstab (I should maybe mention, however, that it is on a different partition).
 My googling also revealed that not having mounted boot while in chroot and then updating the system may have caused the issue. I tried reinstalling linux after making sure to mount boot while in chroot but that didn&#x27;t help. I also tried running mkinitcpio -p linux in arch-chroot, but that didn&#x27;t help either unfortunately.
 I also tried extending the fstab as suggested here, with no luck.
 Any idea what I can try next?

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve installed Arch with archinstall pretty easily, it works VERY well, and I&#x27;m impressed! Honestly, after I set it up, It&#x27;s probably gonna be my daily driver, however, I don&#x27;t know how to install NVIDIA drivers on older GPUs on Arch based distros.
 I have a GTX 660 2GB GPU from MSI.
 I want to install the 
 &gt; nvidia-470xx-dkms
 package, but I have no idea how, and while you&#x27;re at it, could you please tell me what else should I take notice of, and what to do after driver installation, cheers!

                              <span>There are a lot of posts and articles about how you dual boot, and the wiki of course, but nothing says why or if you should. This is a two part question:
  
One of the main benefits of Arch is that it is a bare bones, diy system, meaning you know everything that is on your system because you put it there. This provides you better control over your system, performance in removing unnecessary background tasks like usage statistics, and encapsulation of the personal data on your machine. With a Windows OS, all that goes out the window. You have a lot of noise and diagnostics programs, and Arch&#x27;s rolling release model is great, but Windows is still going to force reboot my computer for updates right, making Arch moot right? The reason to run Windows at all, in my case, is exe applications that don&#x27;t have an Linux executable/aren&#x27;t in aur. For that I used a vm on my laptop. But moving towards a dedicated PC for workstation for programming and streaming as well as entertainment/gaming station, I may need to switch back to Windows for less compatibility issues with new games or streaming programs. So if I need to use Windows for compatibility, why use Arch at all? Or has Linux gaming come far enough to feel confident there won&#x27;t be as many compatibility issues staying with Arch?
 
If dual booting Arch and Windows does make sense (eg. I like Arch but if I need Windows for compatibility with software), is there a way to cut out the noise from it and make it more like Arch? Removing the unnecessary background diagnostics tasks, facial authentication, automatic updates, etc. Or what is the most lightweight Windows OS to dual boot with Arch that would resolve Arch compatibility issues?

                              <span>I flashed the arch iso (archlinux-x86_64.iso) using balenaEtcher onto a USB drive. I reboot my machine, but the drive does not show up in the UEFI boot selection menu.
 I thought it may be a problem with my drive, but after flashing fedora onto it, the machine boots successfully.
 I checked the SHA256 of the iso, and tried both OSes with Fedora Media Writer. Same result.
 I read the wiki, but it seems to be about problems after booting into the usb. I am new to arch, so I may not have found the correct wiki page.
 Help?

 So back a month ago wireplumber was removed for media-session. Last update switched it back. Lost audio.

 Haven&#x27;t come across any .pacnew files in any directories so far.

                              <span>Full
 Recently I wanted to play an old game that I like a lot, GTA San Andreas, so I installed in Bottles
 The installation process went fine and everything looks alright, although when I tried to play, the game just starts in fullscreen and crashes my entire laptop
 I tried change configs, using system wine or caffe, running 64bit or 32bit env, activating and deactivating DXVK, VKD3D, Dedicated GPU, Sync, Windows versions, Gamemode, etc. The only thing that change something, is when I start in windowed mode
 I also tried to install directly with wine (no Bottles or anything else, just wine) and the results are the same
 So, when wine is windowed mode I can open the game and play, but when I let wine run fullscreen, my laptop freezes and I have to hard shutdown holding the power button
 TLDR
 I want play an old game, but if I let wine run in fullscreen, freezes my entire laptop, while running wine in windowed mode the game plays smooth
 My configurations
  
Arch Linux
 Kernel: 5.18.8-arch1-1
 Wine version: wine-7.11
 Gnome 42.2
 X11
 12 GB Ram DDR4
 Laptop Aspire E15 E5-553G-T4TJ
  
Post
 I have no idea what&#x27;s happening and I can&#x27;t find any log or crash message as well

                              <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;m currently NOT using an eGPU but I&#x27;m looking for a new laptop (must be a laptop cus I&#x27;m a student) and I haven&#x27;t made my mind if I want a gaming laptop with decent battery life (e.g. Zephyrus G14) or a more work-oriented, cheaper laptop and later save for an eGPU so I can play some heavier games. One of my main uncertainties is how hard would it be to configure Arch to use the external eGPU.
 If someone has some experience with eGPUs on Arch, can you clarify this for me, please? 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to use Pipewire for simple audio tasks like listening to music, youtube videos, and zoom calls. I&#x27;ve got it working at a very basic level with the pipewire and pipewire-{alsa,pulse} packages, and I have output through my laptop speakers. I am also able to control the output level with alsamixer. However, how can I learn about doing more complex things like selecting the audio output, changing input levels, using media keys on my keyboard, etc? I&#x27;ve looked around on the internet and can&#x27;t find much, and the Pipewire docs are all about programming with C/C++. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 When using secure boot with custom keys, and luks full disk encryption tied to the TPM PCR 7 (secure boot state), a system can be encrypted but booted unattended up to the login prompt (GDM in my case).
 What steps, if any, can be taken to secure the login prompt in order to achieve security level similar to a luks password prompt at boot ? 
 Thanks !

                              <span>I have used pre-fab distros for years. I got hooked on building Arch into my dream machine about 6 months ago and have built and rebuilt my OS at least 15 times. I have decided to build a server without a DE and only the items I need to serve what I need. I do have a monitor on it and would like Xterm to look as good as possible.
 If I am understanding the Arch Wiki there is no config file and all configuration must be done through X Resources. I could use some tips or opinions on the best settings and the best way to go about making it look decent. I am using zsh.... I&#x27;m sure some will find that to be blasphemy but I love the powerlevel look and I have built a decent config that I am used to.

                              <span>Pretty much the title.
 So I ran Arch on my previous PC (using gnome), and one day after an update my audio started playing up in a kind of peculiar way. Let&#x27;s say that I have two options in my settings to pick from for audio output, Analogue Hi Res, and Digital Hi Res. When I would boot and triy to do something like play a song, the song would be stuck in a kind of &quot;pending to play&quot; state until I open the settings panel and changed from whatever output device had been selected on boot (let&#x27;s say digital) to whatever option wasn&#x27;t yet selected (so let&#x27;s say analogue).
 Ok so it&#x27;s choosing the wrong audio device on startup yeah? Nope lol. After choosing the correct output device and having sound play, if I would pause or halt the system audio for even a short amount of time (I&#x27;m talking less than 10 seconds), when I would resume playback the audio player would be stuck in the same halted loading state until I go back into the settings panel and change the output device back again (so back to digital from analogue in this example). This would have to have been repeated every time I paused system audio, because the audio would just continuously ping pong between analogue and digital.
 I thought this was just something I had done stupidly having had Arch running on this system for over 4 years, and didn&#x27;t bother digging into the problem because I was building a new machine anyway.
 Well, I built the new machine, and it was working fine for a few weeks until today. I ran a system update and noticed that wireplumber was in conflict with pipewire-media-session. I chose to replace the lib wireplumber, and then boom. The output device switching issue resumed again.
 Does anyone have any idea what&#x27;s doing on? Or where I would start to debug this? It&#x27;s driving me mad hahaha.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I have a laptop where I set up an installation of Arch and an installation of Debian. Whenever I boot into Arch, I get a message &quot;start job is running for /dev/disk/by-uuid/aa....&quot;, which lasts a minute and a half, followed by the message &quot;dependency failed for /dev/disk/by-uuid/aa....&quot; and then &quot;dependency failed for Swaps&quot; (note the uuid value shown matches the swap partition&#x27;s). After this the system does successfully boot into Arch. Any help you can offer will be much appreciated, I have provided more details bellow.
 - The Arch installation uses sytemd-boot to boot, Debian&#x27;s comes using grub.
 - The two installations each have their own root partition, they share an EFI partition, a swap partition, and a storage partition I made to store pictures, documents, etc.
 - As far as I can tell the fstab file in the Arch installation is correct (has the partitions I would expect to be there).
 -The computer defaults to Debian&#x27;s boot menu, where there is an option to boot into Arch. I have tried going into the BIOS and entering through Arch&#x27;s boot menu, when I do this the problem persists.
 ​
 Once again, any help will be greatly appreciated.
 Edit: Added a detail I thought was important.

There are some basic programs that we keep coming back to that are so integrated into the stack that we forget they’re even there. However, when it comes to things like desktop environments, it can be hard to determine the best option for exactly what you’re going to use it for.

                              <span>Hello. My Dell Latitude E6420 running Arch recently had an unexpected abrupt poweroff (battery came loose by accident) and now it won&#x27;t connect to wifi. I&#x27;m using iwd with dhcpcd.
 Output of iwctl station wlan0 scan &amp;&amp; iwctl station wlan0 get-networks just says &quot;No networks available&quot;. iwd.service and dhcpcd.service are running; I enabled them manually with systemctl to make sure.
 rfkill shows two wlan devices, phy0 and dell-wifi. Both are soft and hard unblocked.
 ping 9.9.9.9 simply says &quot;Network is unreachable&quot;.

                              <span>Hello Archers,
 I&#x27;ve just gotten up and running with my first ever Arch install, on my laptop, and almost everything is working great. 
 The one snag is: I&#x27;ve encrypted the hard drive using [https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#LVM_on_LUKS](LVM on LUKS). At boot, I&#x27;m prompted to type the encryption passphrase. With a USB keyboard, I can type it in no problem. But during boot my laptop&#x27;s built-in keyboard is non-functional - no keystrokes register at all, it&#x27;s as though it&#x27;s disconnected - so I have no way of booting without a USB keyboard attached. 
 The keyboard itself is physically fine, and works perfectly in the bootloader and in the DE.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t think the issue is in the arch itself, but as the thing happened while I was trying to install arch, I decided to write here.
 So, I have been trying to install Arch from a USB drive and PC just doesn&#x27;t see the USB until I switch Secure Boot mode to either on of off. Then the system boots up normally (of course, if I turned SB back off after that), but if I reboot, it happens again.
 I made the installation medium using Rufus, installation is in UEFI mode.

Can someone suggest me how to do that ? in google search i found ways to extend the partition with free space already existing, I want help in creating the free space from Home partition and then extending / partition with fdisk. Or is it better to have same partition for both root &amp; home? if yes, how to merge both the partitions?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 on my desktop system, the total ram size is reported as 32021 (free -m), whereas on my laptop, it is reported as 27893 with the same command.
 This puzzles me, as both systems have 2 16GB RAM sticks installed, so to my understanding free -m should show the same (or at least very similar) total capacity.
 Any idea why this happens, and how to fix it?
 (Both systems were installed using the same install script, both run the same software, nothing has been changed in terms of memory, both systems are up to date)

                              <span>I did an update this morning and found that all proton games would crash afterwards.
 I couldn&#x27;t pin down exactly what the problem is but it appears that all proton versions, experimental and otherwise would cause directx errors. This was with forcing radv and regular radeon drivers. 
 I ended up restoring from a timeshift backup for now as I didn&#x27;t have a lot of time to crawl through journalctl.

                              <span>microcode and DSDT are examples where an extra initramfs file is inserted before the regular one (generated by mkinitcpio). So how does kernel deal with those?
 I know for the regular one, such as \initramfs-linux.img, kernel would mount it to / and execute the /init file. But if there are more than one initrd&#x3D; params, does boot loader load all of them in one shot to some memory area and kernel process them one by one according to some rules? Does kernel unmount/delete the first one before mounting the next one to /? For example, if I insert an intel-ucode.img in front of initramfs-linux.img, does kernel also mount it at /? what happens afterwards then since there is no /init file in the ucode image, so how does kernel know what to do with it? and how does kernel know it needs to load the next initramfs file which is initramfs-linux.img?
 I tried adding debug boot parameter, but still didn&#x27;t see any log file under /run/initramfs/, what did I miss?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m farily new to arch and I&#x27;m trying it out on VirtualBox before using it on my actual PC.
 Right now I have qtile installed as a window manager, and I&#x27;m using picom as a compositor. My problem is that when changing my shell fomr bash to zsh (or any other, like fish), the opacity in my terminal (alacritty) just stops working.
 I Have no idea what the problem could be, since by using bash and picom it works just fine. Also alacritty itself does not change its background opacity when I set it inside the configuration file, but only if I have picom running.
 Any help?

                              <span>Hi, few weeks ago, I switched to using Wayland. Setup was quite easy following the wiki. However, when I try to run XWayland applications (wine/proton games in my case), I get massive stuttering - especially when moving camera or when character are moving in the scene. The weird thing is, there was originally no such problem and this seems to only start last week. I went through the wiki again, reinstalling what was needed, but without any luck. I am running Gnome, but had the same problem when I switched to KDE on Wayland. 
 I also saw wiki mentioning EGLStreams vs GBM buffer APIs, but I not sure what to make of it as this only occurs in XWayland applications - native games that are not running through wine work flawlessly.
 Am I missing something or do others have the same problem?

                              <span>Hey all, I recently noticed every time a dkms module needed to be updated it was installing into a whole bunch of old kernels. I went to look into /lib/modules and found that it was over 5GB in size and full of old kernel modules. Are these safe to delete?
