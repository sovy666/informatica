 It has been claimed that the drive is likely dead. I find that a bit ridiculous since I had used it earlier.

                              <span>I&#x27;m having some trouble understanding how permissions on a system differ between logging in at the console and starting an x session remotely. When I connect to my arch host via ssh and start an x session with startx, certain permissions aren&#x27;t available that are when I log in at the console.
 For example, I can stream Steam games perfectly to my phone when I physically log in. However if I start an x session remotely the games don&#x27;t receive gamepad input. I&#x27;ve tried fiddling with custom rules so that my user account can w/r to /dev/input but this doesn&#x27;t make a difference. My DualShock 4 controller can still control the mouse over Steam Link when it is connected to my phone over bluetooth (even outside of games).
 I&#x27;m on kernel version 5.17.1 running X11 and the latest version of Steam.

                              <span>Would like to have an instance of Archlinux on WSL2.
 From what I can tell; this requires the userspace tools and an windows installer. Please correct me if that&#x27;s wrong.
 I&#x27;d like to know if anyone in the community has done this, and whether you have any recommendations for a seamless experience. Hoping to go without issue.
 If I&#x27;m not able to install Archlinux, then possibly Fedora or OpenSUSE tumbleweed.
 How would recommend I attempt to install Arch? Do you have any guides to reference?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>So I recently purchased an XPS 9710 but have been having issues with the touchpad.
 ​
 The touchpad works fine, stutters, then seems to have issues where clicking anywhere on the touchpad is registered as a right click. 
 Googling hasn&#x27;t really lead me anywhere for this so I was wondering if anyone here has experienced similar.

                              <span>I already had python-pip installed via pacman.
 I then did pip install --user --upgrade pip.
 I then realised I may have caused conflicts so I did sudo pip uninstall pip (I think?) as non-sudo made errors and would not execute.
 I then checked pip which no longer existed so realised it probably uninstalled system python-pip
 I then reinstalled it sudo pacman -S python-pip
 It completed but loads of warnings/errors arose 
 warning: could not get file information for usr/bin/pip warning: could not get file information for usr/bin/pip3 warning: could not get file information for usr/bin/pip3.10 warning: could not get file information for usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pip-21.0-py3.10.egg-info/ warning: could not get file information for usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pip-21.0-py3.10.egg-info/PKG-INFO warning: could not get file information for usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pip-21.0-py3.10.egg-info/SOURCES.txt warning: could not get file information for usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pip-21.0-py3.10.egg-info/dependency_links.txt warning: could not get file information for usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pip-21.0-py3.10.egg-info/entry_points.txt warning: could not get file information for usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pip-21.0-py3.10.egg-info/not-zip-safe warning: could not get file information for usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pip-21.0-py3.10.egg-info/top_level.txt warning: could not get file information for usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pip/ warning: could not get file information for usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pip/__init__.py 
 So how do I clean up the mess and make sure only python-pip is active and properly installed - minus those warnings.

As for a test, I tried connecting the headphone on Windows, and the headphone, as well as its internal mic, worked perfectly fine. However, when I do the same thing on Linux the mic of the headphones does not work so I&#x27;m only getting output. I use PulseAudio.

                              <span>Hi guys! I have a problem after installing Arch Linux.
 1 problem. I can&#x27;t adjust the brightness of the display, neither from the buttons, nor from the control panel. The slider itself supposedly changes the brightness, but nothing actually does.
 2 problem. The touchpad works in a strange way. Clicks work, but all the gestures do not work properly. It is impossible to copy, select text, as well as to use the buttons without physically pressing the touchpad, swipes do not want to work.
 3 problem. How to enable or add battery power mode &quot;maximum performance, balanced, energy efficient&quot;
 4 problem. The physical power button does not work. I can&#x27;t put the laptop into &quot;sleep&quot; mode when pressing it, only shutting down after a long press.
 Configuration: HP Aero 13 bc-0006ur. Ruzen 5 5600U. 2560x1600, 13.3&quot; 16 RAM 512 SSD
 I would appreciate a detailed answer! 😊

                              <span>So I wanted to get back in to Archlinux after using Windows for Gaming (EAC Games). My problem is that I can&#x27;t boot Arch Liveusb. After flashing it in to my USB and restarting my Laptop, I get a error
 ACPI Bios Error (Bug) : Could not resolve symbol {\_SB.PC10.GP17.VGR.LCDBCM.AFN71. AE_NOT_FOUND Error : Aborting method \_SB.PC10.GP17.VGA.LCD.BCM due to previous error (AE_NOT_FOUND) 
 I already found posts that&#x27;s not really my fault and that&#x27;s poor BIOS updates from manufacturers. But I once installed Arch and it worked fine...

                              <span>Hello! I have multiple monitors and they all don&#x27;t work well with Dithering, which is automatically enabled for each monitor in nvidia-settings. I turn it off manually via the nvidia-settings control panel, but the settings don&#x27;t persist after a system restart. If I restart the PC - I just need to run nvidia-settings and the settings will be applied.
 ​
 How can I enable the setting dithering: disable for system start? So far, to start the system, I have set the launch of the entire nvidia settings, but this is quite expensive ..

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to Linux and for the past week, I&#x27;ve been trying to use bspwm and polybar. I&#x27;m trying to customize the workspaces of my polybar so I can add icons to them, but I&#x27;ve noticed that the default polybar script from the official github page does not contain a bspwm module anymore, which means that a big part of customization is left out. What is there that I can do to still be able to customize my workspaces and add icons there? I&#x27;ve also followed a tutorial where this YouTuber lets you use his polybar script, but I&#x27;m also having issues with that as the fonts and icons won&#x27;t load. Is there anyone who would like to help me configure a polybar? I&#x27;ve spent days going at this with not much success so far. Thank you in advance.

                              <span>For months I have been dual-booting Windows 10 and Arch (using rEFInd), no problem. All of a sudden, when I tried to boot Arch, by the time LightDM should appear, the screen goes black (no keyboard cursor, not even back-lighting) and the computer goes silent. As if the computer turned off, but it is still on. The only way to turn it off is to hold the power button.
 What could be the issue? I haven&#x27;t seen any similar issue online. The only thing that comes to mind is something regarding hibernate mode not working properly, but that still doesn&#x27;t make much sense.
 EDIT: after a couple restarts it started working normally for some reason, but I know that it&#x27;s very dangerous to hold the power button, so I guess this is still relevant.

 info:
 sof-firmware installed, alsa-utils installed, pulseaudio installed
 i get this message when I boot:

 from this post, I tried adding snd_hda_intel.enable_silent_stream&#x3D;0 to my kernel parameters, and it removed the snd_hda_codec_hdmi message, but HDMI audio still doesn&#x27;t work.

                              <span>I like Arch and am a roughly 10 year user. Title says it all. 
 I recently noticed the pacman install of GIMP (some 240+MB) now brings in &quot;gvfs&quot; as a dependency. Not allowing gvfs in my system -- not sure if GIMP has brought it in a long time, but just noticed. Anyone have a good experience with a lighter editor? Thx.

                              <span>My laptop frequently crashes after I wake it from sleep. Since I don&#x27;t get any messages, I don&#x27;t know how to fix the problem. There has to be some way of determining the cause, but I don&#x27;t know where to look. 
 Like I said, this only happens when I open the lid of my laptop to wake it from sleep. 
 Thank you.

 I don&#x27;t know why it happens, but only happens with Arch and FF. Works fine with FF on Fedora. Probably missing some package. Any ideas?

                              <span>I am always using the bin version of packages from AUR, such as pandoc, ms edge, freefilesync and even paru. The obvious advantage is that these packages are much faster to install and update than the non-bin version.
 However I would like to ask the forum if there&#x27;s any downside that I might not be aware of by using the bin versions of these packages?

                              <span>Yesterday I ran a Windows 10 update which required a restart. My setup is Windows 10 and Archlinux dual-booted on the same SSD. Windows was installed first, so I use its esp for systemdboot, and a separate partition for XBOOTLDR. After the Windows update, my Arch loader entries no longer appear in the boot menu. Windows itself, and all my NTFS partitions, work fine.
 I checked the various common culprits, and confirmed that secure boot, fast boot, fast start, and Windows hibernation were all still disabled. My next step was to boot up the Arch live ISO to attempt repair, but I&#x27;ve found that I can no longer mount sda5 and sda6 to /mnt/boot and /mnt, or at all for that matter. I get an error along the lines of bad fs, bad options, or bad superblock.
 I am confused because those are my two Linux partitions (formatted to fat32 and ext4, respectively,) and neither are mounted in Windows. How could the WIndows update have messed them up? My theory is that the update resized some Windows partitions, which messed up some blocks, but I&#x27;m not a filesystem expert.
 Can fsck repair this issue, and is there a way of preventing WIndows from doing this again in the future?

I was planning on running Arch as I thought it would be a fun learning experience, but I am concerned about how well arch will perform with the newer 12th gen CPUs. I wasn’t able to find much information on the subject and was hoping someone here could provide some information. Thanks!

 Right now i&#x27;ve gotten a new laptop (ZephyrusG14) and insalled arch, i use awesomeWM. 
 The problem i&#x27;m having is that when a i load X11, awesome does not show any icon and if i try to launch ulauncher, &quot;nitrogen --restore&quot; or any kind of explorer window (i.e. open file on chromium) it chrashes and does nothing.
 Both ulauncher and Nitrogen give a mesage regarding PixBuff:
 Nitrogen:

                              <span>Usually I just install endevourOS because it takes less time and apparently it preconfigures most stuff (firewall for example) but I&#x27;m considering a fresh install of vanilla arch just to reduce bloat and preinstalled software. Is there anything that I should sure to set-up or configure after the install process (besides a window manager and firewall etc.) Or is it just an install it and your good to go type of thing?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently on Windows 10, on a laptop with 2 drives: a 120GB SSD and 1TB HDD. I&#x27;ve done a few installations on virtual machines, so I&#x27;m familiar with the normal process. However, when I eventually do my actual installation, I want to (1) have access to both drives and (2) keep all the data that&#x27;s currently on the hard drive. How do I achieve this?
 I&#x27;ve looked around for answers but I&#x27;m still not sure, and I want to be absolutely certain before trying anything.

                              <span>Hi, I am new to arch. Pamac is a great help if you want to get app installations fast done. Unfortunately, pamac with snap and flatpak support is somehow broken. I can install only pamac-aur. Is there a possibility to upgrade pamac afterwards? Thanks for any advice in advance.

                              <span>Installing was effortless with archinstall script, picked Gnome as desktop. Everything left at default and went smoothly, normal kernel.
 These were my first 5 minutes into it:
 - Opening a terminal, keyboard layout is not the one I just set at install time
 - Gnome settings open just fine but wallpaper changer doesn&#x27;t work. Theme changer from light to dark isn&#x27;t working either.
 - I try launching Gnome Tweaks from the Gnome Launche but it doesn&#x27;t launch anything.
 - I go back to the Terminal to at least enlarge the font, however the &#x27;Custom font&#x27; checkbox isn&#x27;t working at all, despite being clickable.
 - I try to document all of this for a friend but the Gnome recorder (CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+R) stops recording at random in the first 10 seconds
 - Trying to &quot;Pin to dash&quot; Terminal doesn&#x27;t actually pin anything
 Nothing of this is important but sets the mood for everything else, pretty much leaves me wondering what else could be broken and made me instantly drop my idea about switching to Arch in my main rig. The iso used was archlinux-2022.04.05-x86_64.iso
 New user experience aside, what could be causing all of this?

                              <span>So, let&#x27;s give some details (or rather, all the details I can afford to give).
 Basically, last night I updated my install (yes, using sudo pacman -Syu and I do update it somewhat often btw) before turning off my PC and everything seemed to work. Yet, now in the next day, I can enter the grub, yes, but after selecting to boot Arch (be it the Linux Kernel or the Linux-Zen one) and it seems to load normally but then it simply remains pitch black. And no, it&#x27;s not just the graphical user interface, I can&#x27;t bring the terminal up either.
 So, I tried using my installation media on a stick to repair, but weirdly it doesn&#x27;t seem to boot either. I can select it from the boot menu on the bios, and it does boot into the &quot;options&quot; (install UEFI, install UEFI with voice, RAM etc.) but it doesn&#x27;t matter what I select, it too seems to fail to boot.
 I am no &quot;arch newbie&quot;, been using it for a year or so now, but I am really lost here, I suspect (but I hope it&#x27;s not) something hardware-related at this point
 EDIT: Update, was able to enter the installation media by booting it on legacy mode and using the load into RAM option
 EDIT2: Ok, was able to chroot by doing so, updated the system once again via sudo pacman -Syu something with a package called libvterm broke but now it&#x27;s fixed. Install repaired, problem solved. Feel free to point out to this thread as a possible solution for others.

                              <span>Hello, I just set up an Arch server that will have some VMs permanently running on it.
 ​
 I thought that shutting down the host would gracefully handle the VMs but i don&#x27;t think it does, as soon as I pass the shutdown -h now command, the VM networks drop (I am pinging to check).
 ​
 Then, after I reboot the host, the VMs go through a full boot. I think the system is just forcing the VMs off, the whole process feels way too fast.
 ​
 I found the libvirt-guests.service in the Wiki, but there is no mention of how to use it and the /etc/conf.d/libvirt-guests file that it says to read does not exist.
 ​
 Can I have some help on this please? Thank you!

 Normally I run updates once a day, so I know that it&#x27;s unusual that for 2 days in a row, pacman tells me that all repositories (including some testing) are up-to-date. I have edited my mirrorlist a couple of times to try different servers with the same result.
 Does anyone know what&#x27;s going on? Is the Arch team on vacation? Does this have something to do with the reports of web servers being down? Something else?

                              <span>Hello fellow archers,
 I&#x27;ve created a small AUR helper that builds packages in docker containers.
 Just wanted to know your thoughts. Feature ideas are welcome!

 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi guys! 
 Question about installing Arch Linux. I own an HP Pavilion Aero 13 laptop. Here is my configuration:
 Model: 13-be0006ur
 CPU: Ryzen 5 5600U (15W)
 RAM: 16GB
 SSD: 512GB
 Display: 13&quot; IPS 2560x1600
 WiFi: Realtek 8852AE
 When installing Arch Linux, it is not possible to connect to Wi-Fi because there is no driver for Realtek 8852AE. There is no Ethernet port and the iPhone is used as a modem via USB. But Arch Linux doesn&#x27;t see the iPhone, as far as I know, because when connecting via USB the iPhone needs to use iTunes as a modem. Can you tell me how to install the driver then and install Arch Linux? Do I need to look for an Android phone? I&#x27;m confused and can&#x27;t solve this problem. I would appreciate your help!

 I&#x27;m going to install arch linux on my main system soon and have an empty 128GB SSD to install it onto. However, I have other drives with other OS&#x27;s and important files on them and games as well. How do I choose which disk I am installing Arch on?

 Do I have to add that in myself?
 63d63  pkgname&#x3D;(&quot;$pkgbase&quot; &quot;$pkgbase-headers&quot;) 
 If so where should it go? I can&#x27;t tell from the wording if it is saying that it is already added or that you should do it yourself if you want it to skip. If the latter how do I add it? Direct to the PKGBUILD rather than separate file? If so where?

                              <span>Hello everybody, hope y&#x27;all doing great, so I happened to run into this issue with any Java application in dwm where the window doesn&#x27;t render anything and only displays a blank grey window. Now I have read the wiki and tried the three fix I had found.
 wmname, AWT_TOOLKIT&#x3D;MToolkit, _JAVA_AWT_NONREPARENTING&#x3D;1
 None of these seems to work for whatever reason and I couldn&#x27;t find anything else other than this.
 I have jdk8 and jdk18 installed on my system, any help would be useful.

                              <span>SetupDiag is a free Microsoft utility that can be very useful for diagnosing any problems you may encounter in Windows updates. It will save you a lot of time if you run this program before migrating your Windows to a higher version: its generated log files will tell you what can possibly go wrong. Also, if you run into an unsuccessful update, SetupDiag will detect the root cause of failure for you to take corrective measures.
