                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to use appimage launcher to add rpan studio appimage to my menu system bit for some reason it&#x27;s not working. 
 OBS Studio works fine but for some reason rpan studio isn&#x27;t doing that.
 The program runs fine. I just can&#x27;t get it to show up in the menu.
 I&#x27;ve thought about using an older version but I doubt that will change anything. 
 I&#x27;m using Arch Linux with the Cinnamon desktop. Should I try KDE plasma instead?
 System specs are ThinkServer TS140. It&#x27;s pretty fast with 16gb of ram. 5tb hdd for the /home and the rest is on a 1tb ssd. This system is super fast! 
 I don&#x27;t know why it isn&#x27;t working.

                              <span>So I’ve done initial setup of arch and everything is good (I did that all with an external mouse and keyboard) but I just can’t figure out how to get the mousepad and keyboard to work. I assume that there are some missing drivers or something but my prior research has come up fruitless (unless I missed somthing very obvious) I am as you can tell very new to arch and would appreciate any help.
 Edit: I am using the newest version

                              <span>I recently tried to update my system to the new kernel, after not having updated for maybe two weeks. And upon rebooting after a completed update. I was given a grub boot error. Of an unexpected end of vmlinuz file. I tried rebuilding my mkinitcpio, but that gave me an error of the linux file being incomplete or empty. I then restored from prior backup, and tried updating again. Which led to the same error in grub. I have looked around, and haven’t been able to find any solutions. Any ideas?

 error: m4: signature from &quot;Antonio Rojas arojas@archlinux.org&quot; is unknown trust :: File /var/cache/pacman/pkg/m4-1.4.19-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst is corrupted (invalid or corrupted package (PGP signature)).
 This is only one example, it outputs mulitple of those. I tried to reset the key database and multiple commands i found online but it still doesnt work. Hope someone can help me out :)

                              <span>So, the package lib32-openjpeg2 on AUR got recently updated to version 2.5.0, but the current one on my system (2.4.0) has a dependency on openjpeg2&#x3D;2.4.0. So I cannot update with pacman, because then my openjpeg2 would get updated to 2.5.0, which breaks the lib32-openjpeg2 dependency on it being only 2.4.0, and I cannot update lib32-openjpeg2 from AUR (using yay) because it wants to update openjpeg2 from repos before and it fails the same.
 So, what&#x27;s the way out of this?
  
EDIT: Solved using the --nodeps (-Sd) option.

                              <span>When I&#x27;m in the chroot during installation /etc/resolv.conf is a symlink to another file. I want to replace it with my own file but anything I do doesn&#x27;t work. If I try to remove the symlink or replace it with my own file it says Device or resource busy. How can I do it from inside the chroot? My setup scripts run in chroot so I&#x27;d like to solve it there.

                              <span>Novice Arch user here, I&#x27;m installing a lot of aur packages and in most cases they are very downloaded by everyone.
 If I understood right how the AUR works, a dangerous package is one that is not very downloaded and ... that&#x27;s about it. I think/hope there is moderation done on the AUR packages so the major part of dangerous packages are deleted very early.
 So correct me if I&#x27;m wrong but there very few packages out there that are really dangerous for my system ?
 + Another question : How is moderation on the AUR atm ? (sorry for my english btw)

                              <span>Hi,
 A few days ago, I had a weird Bluetooth headset crash, audio stopped and the headset acted like it was connected and turned off at the same time. As I already had this kind of situations, I disabled Bluetooth, turned it back on and reconnected the headset. But this time, upon reconnecting, I had no sound coming out from it.
 The only sound I am able to hear are the notification sounds from GNOME. That&#x27;s it.
 I tested a BT speaker, a wired headset and even the internal speakers wouldn&#x27;t work at all, which is very annoying because I use this laptop mostly for entertainment.
 I started running some tests : 
 The laptop speakers do work properly. I tested under Windows 10 (the laptop dual boots) and the speakers and BT speakers do work properly.
 I tried to make it forget the headset that had the crash and pairing it back to no avail.
 speaker-test (from alsa-utils) didn&#x27;t work so I guess there&#x27;s the issue ?
 EasyEffects seem to detect audio from apps (I tested with Firefox, Audacious and VLC) but no sound waves are displayed, indicating that the issue must be before PipeWire in the audio software stack. In the case of Audacious, it&#x27;s internal sound wave display works, indicating that audio is being decoded by the app.
 No, the sound was not muted and the correct output was chosen in the settings. That&#x27;s the first things I&#x27;ve checked.
 I&#x27;m pretty sure the issue lies within ALSA but how can it be persistent after reboot if it was a crash ? Is there a way to put it back to default settings ?
 I&#x27;m running pretty much the same audio software stack on my main desktop and I regularly use BT speakers with it and I hadn&#x27;t encountered this issue (it runs on KDE but that shouldn&#x27;t affect audio as far as I&#x27;m aware of).

 Console (vt) size on UHD is 1/4 of the monitor. While on FullHD shows console on a whole surface. Resolution (dpi) is proper, btw.
 If FullHD is disconnected and UHD monitor is the only one connected, it shows console on a full surface as well.

                              <span>I have been having an issue where pacman is installing to my root partition that is only 30GB so installing things like the cudnn package is filling up my entire drive along with other things that I have only just realized are doing that. I have been looking for a way to make it so that pacman installs in my main LVM partition, but have found that nothing on the wiki that says I can even do that. So with this in mind, my question is this: Is there a way to change where pacman installs so that it&#x27;s not in my root partition or will I have to reinstall and give my root partition more space keeping in mind the packages I want to install?
 ​
 I have done my best to RTFM for pacman and the closest thing I have found is a reddit post suggesting it would be possible to change the pacman package installation directory. This would be to create a hook which I am assuming means if it hits this directory redirect it to another one. Though I don&#x27;t know enough to know if this is good solution or something that would bite me later.

                              <span>tldr: the previous RAM configuration for the efly system was overly conservative and not aligned with modern hardware capabilities. depending on your available ram, these recent changes can easily increase your virtual file system space by 4000%+.
 modern desktop systems quite often have 64GB of ram or more available. but the efly live system (repo here) had a very conservative restriction of just 256MB for the copy-on-write virtual file system.
 the arch wiki describes a solution. but this solution is manual. and you need to know that it&#x27;s possible, where to find it and how it works.
 in other words not very practical. so i&#x27;ve been playing around a bit and wrote a script, that runs at boot and adjusts the virtual file system limit (cowspace) according to your available RAM.

When it is connected to my laptop with a cable lsusb says that its a generic x360 controller but when I use the 2.4ghz USB dongle it came with lsusb says that it&#x27;s a Nintendo switch pro controller for some odd reason I&#x27;m just new to this stuff and want to figure out what I need because the wireless dongle worked properly in Linux mint and Ubuntu.

                              <span>I&#x27;m setting up Arch for the first time and I&#x27;m doing everything in i3 if that helps at all. I don&#x27;t have any audio however. I went to try and turn on some lofi while I work on setting up and getting surf installed (if anyone can give me pointers on that as well, I&#x27;d be appreciative). But I don&#x27;t have any audio and I&#x27;ve tried updating pulseaudio, installing and updating pulseaudio-alsa, and made sure my keybindings for volume keys are correct. I still haven&#x27;t had any luck so I&#x27;m hoping someone that&#x27;s better experienced at Arch could give me some pointers. 
 Thank you!
 Quick edit: I skimmed some other posts and updating pulseaudio and pulseaudio-alsa were some of the fixes I&#x27;ve found, but they didn&#x27;t work for me.

                              <span>If you’ve ever had to navigate Windows with the keyboard alone, you know it’s not easy. You may find yourself in such a situation if your mouse keeps freezing and forcing you to find alternative methods to operate your PC. 
    
The most common reason why your mouse keeps freezing is that the mouse driver has become corrupted. Other reasons include outdated drivers and software, faulty hardware, or even viruses. Fortunately, there are some things you can try that might resolve the issue and enable you to get back to work as we shall explore below.
    
Note: The methods included in this article apply to Windows 10 and 11.

 Can someone please explain to me the principles and the process of doing it properly (in order to avoid downloading malicious packages)? I cant seem to understand what the wiki is trying to say, the terminology is too complex for me. 
 Does pacman-key command also apply to AUR, or is there another command for AUR signing?

                              <span>Hey!
 So I’m pretty new to Arch, but I have managed to get it installed and running. Now that is done, there are two questions I was hoping I could get answers for:
  
Once I have it installed, are there any tasks I must do? I’ve seen the ‘General Recommendations’ page on the wiki, but am not sure if that’s something that is optional. Am I good to just start installing apps, or do I need to do some additional configuration first, such as securing my system?
 
Is there any way I could backup my system? Considering how new I am to this I know I’m probably going to break something eventually, and would rather not have to start from scratch each time. On a VM I know I could just take snapshots, but I am not sure how to do something like that outside a VM.
 
On installing AUR packages, I’ve read that I am supposed to manually check the package build (?). Is this what I’m supposed to be checking? If so, what should I be looking for yo make sure it is safe.
 
 Thanks!
 Edit: Added another question

It seems to be impossible to just encrypt it, but I have seen some people to shrink the existing partition, make an encrypted one, move the files, and delete the unencrypted one. Does this work? Do LUKS partitions allow for resizing? What would be the risk of data loss? Thanks.
