If so what have you done to speed up time? For me downloading and building took 5 hours on my i5-1135G7 CPU.

                              <span>So first of all, I&#x27;m an idiot. I unironically bought a new Macbook Pro in 2017. I know, I know. I should have known better. In 2015 I daily drove Ubuntu on an old Dell laptop and that experience was less than pleasant. I walked away thinking, &quot;I&#x27;ll keep my Ubuntu servers, but the desktop is just too much of a headache.&quot;
 Fast foward to 2018. I get a once in a lifetime chance to visit a foreign country with my dad. No way I&#x27;m bringing a $2500 laptop with me, so I bought one of the 2011 Lenovo no HDD specials on eBay, threw a SSD in there, and installed Pop!_OS. Sure as hell wasn&#x27;t going to run Windows.
 After we checked into a hotel, my dad asked to use the laptop to check his emails, the news, etc. He commented how nice the computer was, &quot;Where did you get this?&quot; Lol. I had to agree, it wa…</span>

 How can I set my default audio device to &quot;EasyEffects Sink&quot; using WirePlumber, such that every audio output plays through EasyEffects before going to my sound card?
 Details
 A few days ago, an update swapped out pipewire-media-session for wireplumber, and now Firefox doesn&#x27;t play nice with EasyEffects.
 For all other programs, the audio plays through the correct devices. However, Firefox skips out the EasyEffects steps and goes straight to my USB sound card.

 You can see my full patchbay here; https://imgur.com/a/6XlTLKl
 Using the Helvum patchbay, I can pipe the firefox audio output through EasyEffects Sink first, but it reverts back to going straight to my sound card after pausing any playing audio.

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m installing Arch for the first time and am following the general recommendations page. One thing that&#x27;s not quite clear to me is the CPU frequency scaling. The wiki mentions scaling governors aswell as drivers and lists a few for both.
 However, it also states this:
  
A default scaling driver and governor are selected automatically 
  
Do I need to install those governors and drivers or are there some defaults in place that will handle basic CPU frequency scaling for now?

It&#x27;s not first time I see this, but this time I was curious, what in the hell. I always change that to 755, but somehow it&#x27;s back to 730. Today I understand what causing this: Windows VM... Any Linux or BSD VM don&#x27;t do this, but Windows, sadly yes. Only file in this folder is win10-swtpm.log. Anyone has identical problem? Where I should report this?

                              <span>I&#x27;d really like some clarification on this. I asked this in the stickied thread but got no answer, so I&#x27;m making a post.
 In the AUR there is a stickied comment with instructions on how to manually build mesa-git, because apparently it&#x27;s necessary due to compatibility with llvm.
 Okay, it kind of defeats the whole purpose of using an AUR helper if I have to do this manually, but surely I&#x27;m not the only person using mesa-git, and thus surely someone smarter than me must&#x27;ve written a script or something to automate this process right?
 Right?
 Apparently not. Why not? Is no one using mesa-git? Is every user using mesa-git taking the time to manually download and build mesa-git on every upgrade?
 Loving the downvotes from asking a question. How are people supposed to learn?

                              <span>Hi, sorry sorry for the English, it&#x27;s not my mother tongue, I&#x27;m just translating.
 ​
 I recently reinstalled my Arch and decided to give Btrfs a try. Since creating snapshots is so easy, I was wondering if I might have some mechanism to recover from a damaged system without any external bootable media?
 ​
 For work purposes, I dualboot Arch and Windows, use the Windows boot partition mounted at /boot, and use grub as the bootloader.
 ​
 Create the subvolumes:
 @ --&gt; /
 @home --&gt; /home
 @snapshots --&gt; /.snapshots
 I saw some cool tools like snapper, pacman hooks and grub-btrfs to automatically create snapshots and add them as entries in grub.
 Everything works as expected when I try to boot a snapshot with the same kernel, but if there is an update I can&#x27;t boot the snapshots with an old kernel, it gives me the following error messages:
 ​
 Failed to mount /boot
 Dependency failed for Local File Systems
 ​
 Someone who knows what may be wrong in my configuration... Thanks

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m using pipewire, and pipewire-pulse package. I got a 3.5mm mic so I can record videos for a talk. They gave me a TRSS pin too for the computer.
 I haven&#x27;t messed around much with audio before so it&#x27;s a bit confusing to me, I ran the alsa-info scripthttp://alsa-project.org/db/?f&#x3D;2ee94be11eab9c9abcea641d6b74392c5db9ea98
 And this is the output of &#x60;amixer -c1&#x60;.
 https://gist.github.com/afro-coder/b112a9631555dd4d302eba481cc10cba
 I&#x27;ve added the following to modprodbe.d/hda.conf
 options snd-hda-intel power_save&#x3D;0 power_save_controller&#x3D;N model&#x3D;dell-headset-multi 
 In my Volume control, I can see that there is an option for a headset microphone

 https://gist.github.com/afro-coder/9ed3a2788797e831164dbdebd10381ce
 I can&#x27;t seem to figure out if it&#x27;s actually picking up the audio from the microphone or from the internal microphone and even OBS studio doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to use it, the background noise that I get in the microphone is too loud
 The internal microphone picks up sounds from quite far away I tested the 3.5 mm with android and it silences the surrounding noise, so I&#x27;m not sure what more to check. Any help or nudge would help, been trying to figure this out for days.

 ​
 I&#x27;ve tried booting into a live usb Linux but neither gparted or gnome-disk GUI tools will let me do it.
 Is there no other way but creating a new partition then copy the content over ?

 I&#x27;ve managed to set up arch and had it running fine however, after making changes to my ~/.bash_profile to include startx so it starts on boot. Yes have tested startx before trying to boot into it and it worked fine.
 Im now getting these errors at boot: https://imgur.com/a/xVLkXXk
 This is the log from virtualbox: https://pastebin.com/irYX1XCK
 Any idea&#x27;s how i go about fixing this?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been having ongoing issues with using my laptops GeForce mx 250 GPU. I was able to get things sorted and am using the lts kernel. However I&#x27;m really confused when rereading the Nvidia page, https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA#Installation :
  
 Determine the necessary driver version for your card by:
  
Visiting NVIDIA&#x27;s driver download site and using the dropdown lists. Finding the code name (e.g. NV50, NVC0, etc.) on nouveau wiki&#x27;s code names page or nouveau&#x27;s GitLab, then looking up the name in NVIDIA&#x27;s legacy card list: if your card is not there you can use the latest driver.
  
I&#x27;m not sure that the mx 250 should be using latest driver or not? 
 If it&#x27;s not the GPU I have no idea what is going on at this point... I was able to use steam to game np, but last night all of a sudden any game I try to play is super laggy and killing the game freezes my whole system?! I can&#x27;t find anything useful in the logs, and I&#x27;ve been scratching my head all day. Feel like it&#x27;s the driver still but I could be wrong.

                              <span>I am on a fresh install, on a newly built pc. I do not yet have a display manager, a de, or a wm. 
 without any drivers, or with nouveau installed, everything is fine, normal boot, normal aspect ratio (small font), and startx launches normally, with a few xterms open.
 as soon as i install the proprietary nvidia driver and reboot, i get loads of udev output during boot, the aspect ratio seems to be off (the font is much larger and pixelated), and when I try running startx the system freezes. i am unable to type anything, kill the process, or switch TTY&#x27;s. I have to hard shutdown by holding the power button. 
 after reboot, Xorg logs are clear, no errors. 
 i have installed both the normal and the dkms packages, both do the same thing. I have made sure to add the module to the kernel parameters, and is early loaded. i have blacklisted nouveau every way possible. before running startx, lsmod shows the nvidia module loaded, and shows no sign of nouveau.
 any ideas?

                              <span>You maintain a PKGBUILD in AUR and after a while you notice that upstream source/website is gone. Choose the correct answer (multiple choices possible).
 A) you give it a couple more weeks (optionally pinging the author via social networks/e-mail etc), if upstream website is not restored you disown PKGBUILD and/or file request for deletion. Using software without a maintainer is dangerous and should be avoided by all means!
 B1) despite lacking any advanced coding skills (or having no interest in maintaining the app codebase) you get the app source from archive.org/google cache and upload it to github/gitlab, then update PKGBUILD. You are ready to step down if someone shows up showing a real interest in the application.
 B2) you upload scavenged sources to your personal website (could be Nextcloud) and update PKGBUILD
 C) you update source array to point to archive.org - simple solutions are the best! If the app is useful you keep a copy for yourself (just in case).

                              <span>This is my first time trying someting else than Konsole. Alacritty pops up way snappier and is more lightweight. Why I can&#x27;t open vim nor neovim with it? It just hangs and responds to nothing anymore.
 I tried to open alacritty from other terminal to see what messages it prints prior to hang, but it prints nothing.
 Is this a common problem?

                              <span>Hi all! I am using an small arch install (i3wm + ly dm) with gnome-keying as my keyring app. It used to work fine (I had small password I would enter every time), however today I installed seahorse and tried to change the password to be empty (to stop inputting it every time, I do not worry about security of apps that require it too much), something went wrong. 
 Now, after every reboot, apps that require keyring do not see the existing &quot;Default keyring&quot; which I can see from seahorse and instead prompt to create another &quot;Default keyring&quot; with no regards to the previous one. If you close the app and reopen it during a single session however it seems to be able to use the keyring it has just created no problem. 
 I checked, I do have both gnome-keyring and libsecret up do date, I also tried creating new keyrings with random passwords, empty password, matching my login password. I have also edited PAM config to attempt automatic unlock. Nothing has seem to change and it is really frustrating since everything worked just fine and I am not sure what exactly I did to break it today.

I also don&#x27;t get any extensions on the main page, unless I select compatible with all versions. I have chrome-gnome-shell, and the firefox extension installed. Has anyone encountered this issue? It&#x27;s a fresh install. Thanks :)

 Command used:  sudo efibootmgr --disk /dev/sda --part 1 --create --label &quot;Arch EFISTUB&quot; --loader /vmlinuz-linux --unicode &#x27;initrd&#x3D;\initramfs-linux.img cryptdevice&#x3D;UUID&#x3D;XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX:root root&#x3D;/dev/mapper/root rootflags&#x3D;rw,subvol&#x3D;@ loglevel&#x3D;3 quiet&#x27; --verbose 
 The same command without the --unicode option will boot to a kernel panic (expected) and allows the other entries to boot normally. The kernel parameters may not be correct, but I don&#x27;t think that should cause other entries to be unbootable. The machine is Thinkpad T420 with fully updated firmware.

                              <span>Hi, this is my first post here and I wanna ask if this a good idea make an arch installation in a 240GB SSD with BTRFS, because I&#x27;m interested in the snapshot and COW features of Btrfs. In another hand I have a 1Tb HDD, which I wanna use for storage large files (photos, videos and various stuff). This idea really make sense and which are your suggestions?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve installed arch and I&#x27;ve noticed that the newest kernel (5.18.9-arch1-1) detected my SSD disk as SATA device and labeled it as /dev/sdb. This is not exactly true as it&#x27;s actually an NVMe device. Previously I&#x27;ve installed other distributions like 1-2 years ago and the same device in the same machine was detected as NVMe (labeled as /dev/nvme0n1). Now even nvme list shows nothing.
 Did I missed something or libata really started to pick up some NVMe controllers (because my other machine running arch still relies on nvme kernel module)? Will it affect the performance?
 Yes, I&#x27;m running it in EFI mode and CSM disabled.

                              <span>Finding the downloaded files on your Android device is usually an easy task. The steps to find them vary slightly, depending on what kind of device you have, but for some reason, the downloaded files tend to “disappear” sometimes.
    
The files haven’t disappeared, though. You just have to dig in to your Android device’s settings to find them. In some cases, you may need to install a file manager to help you keep those downloaded files under control. Let’s take a look at some options.

                              <span>Sennheiser is one of the big players in the true wireless earbuds market. Along with Sony, Apple, and Bose, they consistently come out with newer devices that are better than their previous iteration. For Sennheiser, their latest flagship earbuds – the third-generation MOMENTUM True Wireless – now come with better noise cancellation, longer battery life and a lower price point.
    
Inside the Box
    
The third generation of MOMENTUM True Wireless come in a textile-wrapped case. It is stylish enough to bring it out and small enough to put into your bag or pocket. It has a nice touch and feels solid in your hand. The USB-C charging port is at the front of the case, requiring a bit of force to pop the magnetic case open.
   
 
   
Taking the earbuds out of the case, I also noticed they are smaller than their predecessors. In fact, they are 16 percent smaller. With a new oval touch panel, they do look and feels a bit bulky.

                              <span>I downloaded the Heroic Games Launcher yesterday and since it wanted to download games to /home//Games I figured I&#x27;d creates a btrfs subvolume for that so that any games aren&#x27;t included in my snapshots. I set it up fine and added it to my fstab, but now Gnome keeps telling me it&#x27;s removeable.
 I did just copy one of the other subvolume&#x27;s sections in the fstab and change the subvol and mountpoint, but any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!

                              <span>Hi,I try to configure pipewire to automatically change the sample rate, but I have trouble understanding the wiki https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PipeWire#Changing_the_allowed_sample_rate(s))
 Do I need to add the dots or remove them ? I have try with and without and it doesn&#x27;t work.
 I would be really glad if someone could send me his working config file.
 Thanks you!
 ​
 EDIT : I have tried to copy the example conf file, and I have the same problem, as soon as I add a config file, I have no sound after restart

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m using instructions on wiki to install nvidia drivers and I&#x27;m stuck on part after I edit mkinitcpio.conf
 As far as I understood, after editing the file I need to regenerate the initramfs running mkinitcpio command
 Should I use -p or -P as a option, and if I use the first one, which preset should I add after it and why ? I’m using standard kernel
 If I look at the next step (pacman hook), inside of it is a command with -P but I’m not sure
 Sorry if the question is stupid, I tried to find an answer but couldn&#x27;t find anything

                              <span>I just lost power, and rebooted to find my Yubikey OpenPGP &#x27;smartcard&#x27; not working.
 At first I thought the device was damaged somehow in the &#x27;forced&#x27; shutdown while plugged in (I won&#x27;t say always, but typically I&#x27;d unplug it before sleeping/shutting down) - but it works fine still on another Arch system.
 One candidate difference is that this one has gnupg v2.2.36-1, built yesterday and which I installed today; so the agent was probably older before reboot.
 Has anyone else seen this recently?
  $gpg --card-status gpg: OpenPGP card not available: Card error 
 Another card (&#x27;4 Nano&#x27; I think) works fine on this machine with this gpg; the one that doesn&#x27;t is a &#x27;5C NFC&#x27;.
 Edit: WebAuthn works fine, so that does also point towards gpg (/pcscd) specifically.

                              <span>Google Pay makes paying for purchases as easy as holding your phone to a card scanner. However, when you’re used to not carrying around a physical wallet or you want to make online purchases quick and easy, the last thing you want to deal with is Google Pay not working. Whether it’s a problem with card upload or a weak signal, occasionally, Google Pay has issues. Luckily, you can fix most of them through a set of basic troubleshooting steps.

1. Increase Font and Icon Size
    
One of the most common complaints you’re likely to hear from elderly family members about using a smartphone is difficulty in reading. Thankfully, to make text more readable for them, you can increase both the text and display size on their Android device.
    
Head over to the Display settings menu within the Settings app.
