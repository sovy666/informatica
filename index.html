                              <span>I installed Archlinux last year, and it was a disaster from the start because I was struggling to understand some of the basic concepts. I took time to finally read about the things that were causing me trouble, such as Grub, Sudo, networking and some other random issue.
 FF today, and I was feeling like an imposter on Arch. I began asking myself if I could swim. So I decided, hey; let&#x27;s try installing to a VM without diving into man or info files except maybe for a reference, and stick with only the Arch User Install guide. Granted, I still need to do some system maintenance.
 I cautiously booted the April Installer in VirtualBox via UEFI mode, and got nervous that maybe it wouldn&#x27;t work because of vbox issues in the past. I had to choose the EFI image, and then to test, I attempted the archinstall script. This failed when installing packages. I felt defeated for a brief moment, and then remembered that was only to see how it would work. No big deal.
 I then began to follow the Install Guide,which I myself, and many in the Arch community recommend. The time was set, the partitions were made, the system was pacstrapped and it all seemed to go much easier than I recall. Could this work from the first go, I questioned myself? Something must have been done incorrectly, this is not going to work. Having installed LXQt, I ran systemctl enable sddm and hoped for the best.
 Aha, I was greeted with the login screen, and no user listed. I had forgotten a simple useradd So, I switched to tty2 and made the user and rebooted. I then proceeded to boot into my freshly installed Archlinux vm and was presented with the LXQt desktop Environment. There are still many things to do for house cleaning, but this felt like success.
 Don&#x27;t give up.

                              <span>I have two 1 TB SSD&#x27;s on my computer. I have been searching through google for a while now in order to figure out best course of action to utilize this space. Most of the posts I have encountered center around installing on a system with one small root SSD and one bigger home one which does not apply to me. The second SSD can be easily formatted and mounted to be used as a storage space for files but then the package manager does not install packages there when home partition gets full.
 What I planned to do was that one SSD would have boot, swap, root ,home as usual while the other SSD also being included in /home so that it is utilized by the package manager. I don&#x27;t exactly know if this is possible. In any case, can anyone point me into the right direction to look at to figure it out?
 TL;DR my main goal is that I want my OS to use both drives to install packages, both home partition of the 1st drive and the whole of 2nd drive, kinda like treating it as one.

 In Windows, Hybrid sleep/Fast startup is turned off.
 I&#x27;ve tried &#x60;sudo ntfsfix /dev/nvme0n1p1 &amp;&amp; sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /shared, and that works for that running instance, but if I reboot, it doesn&#x27;t stay working, it fails to mount on boot again. I don&#x27;t even need to do the ntfsfix either, mount on its own works fine.
 I have not yet tried going back to the ntfs-3g driver, cause I&#x27;d like to avoid doing that if possible. I had some issue a while back with some program not supporting FUSE drivers, while ntfs3 isn&#x27;t FUSE. I can&#x27;t remember what program it was, but I don&#x27;t want to have to find a workaround for that. I just want my partition work…</span>

                              <span>Hello :-)
 I wanted to try Arch Linux out &amp; am struggling to get to the GUI I was hoping it&#x27;d just boot into it.
 It&#x27;s not :-(
 Here&#x27;s where I got the VM from: https://www.linuxvmimages.com/images/archlinux/#download-links
 I tried to login with the supplied credentials &amp; am taken to a terminal so I tried start &amp; startx neither boots up a GUI.
 I admittedly don&#x27;t know very much about Linux &amp; was going to use this to see what I thought of it since I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s 1 of the common distros becoming pretty popular similar to Manjaro, Linux Mint, Ubunuto/Kubunutu/Lubunutu etc
 Would appreciate it very much if anyone could tell me what to do to get to a GUI based mode.

Any idea? Thanks

                              <span>I recently installed zfs-dkms and zfs-utils from the AUR to get zfs support, and this is the first time I&#x27;m upgrading my system since then. I saw these upgrades available in yay.
 aur/zfs-dkms 2.1.3-1 -&gt; 2.1.4-1 aur/zfs-utils 2.1.3-1 -&gt; 2.1.4-1 
 When I ran the upgrade command it spent a long time upgrading various packages including some of these zfs related things then failed with this error.
 :: installing zfs-utils (2.1.4-1) breaks dependency &#x27;zfs-utils&#x3D;2.1.3&#x27; required by zfs-dkms 
 I had to uninstall zfs-dkms and zfs-utils then reinstall them for it to work. But why did this happen? How can I prevent it from happening on future upgrades?

                              <span>Hey everybody, I&#x27;ve been on arch for a week or two now (as a first time user), and I&#x27;ve finally gotten around to trying to create a swap file for my laptop with 8GiB of RAM. 
 The issue I&#x27;m facing is that while i do know how to create a swap file on an ext4 system, I&#x27;m not quite sure how to do so on a btrfs system with auto snapshot-ting also set up. Simply creating a swap file leads to timeshift not being able to create snapshots, so I have to apparently set up a swap file in a separate sub volume. I frankly don&#x27;t know how to do this, so any and all help with creating swap like this would be appreciated. 
 Going on a tangent, what do you guys think i should be using? Zram or swap? As i said I have a machine with 8gigs of RAM and occasionally this leads to complete freezes after which i have to force reboot. 
 Thanks for all the replies.

                              <span>To lead workshops, I would like to provide a usb flash drives which boots an archlinux on any hardware (I mean x86_64 hardwares... but that can boot on UEFI and Bios).
 But here is the tricky thing :
 I would to have a common OS part which does the boot and hold the different packages, and a choice of the workshop to load (either at boot, either later.
 These workshop configurations would only concern the home directory, and the software launched at boot. By the way, I would also like to forbid the user any modification on neither the flash drive, neither the host machine.
 But I would like to myself be able to change these workshop configurations later on without burning again the full drive. 
 How would you do it ?
 ​
 Here are my ideas :
 1 partition for the system, that would remain read-only.
 1 partition for the mods for each workshop.
 The workshop could be changed by logging to a specific user account, and to avoid modification on the drive, a ram disk would be mounted.
 However, the only hybrid UEFI/Bios boot I encountered so far are from live usb iso... And I definitively don&#x27;t know hos to proceed to add writable partition on such devices...
 ​
 ​
 Any suggestions ?

                              <span>So I&#x27;m writing this because I ran out of ideas on how to fix this. This all started when there was that big firmware update, after update my wi-fi wasn&#x27;t working, because of a bug. I&#x27;m using lvm snapshots so I tried to revert it but it was unsuccessful. Somehow I got kernel mismatch, which is weird because I never had problems like that on my other PC. After that I went in live boot and updated system again. It fixed kernel mismatch. And since then 2 out of 3 updates ended in kernel mismatch.
 I already tried going in live boot and updating again, reverting snapshot. In the latest attempt to update I&#x27;m 100% sure boot partition was mounted because mount printed /dev/nvme0n1p1 mounted on /boot/EFI (nvme0n1p1 is boot partition). It was a while ago when I was trying to fix this issue and I forgot everything that I tried. I tried searching ArchWiki and forums and noting helped me. I did however discover that when you are updating your system, that your boot partition needs to be mounted and if you unmount it it should be empty. If I unmount my partition it&#x27;s not empty (stat initramfs-linux.img shows file was indeed copied there at last update).
 When I try to boot I get:
  
[FAILED] failed to start Load Kernel modules.[FAILED] failed to mount /boot/EFI[DEPEND] Dependency failed for Local File System
  
Then I get emergency shell.
 journalctl -xb mentions:
  
/boot/EFI: unknown filesystem type &#x27;vfat&#x27;
  
cat /etc/fstab
  
UUID&#x3D;ZE69-C2EC /boot/EFI vfat rw,realtime, .... , errors&#x3D;remount-ro 0 2
  
uname -a
  
5.16.10-arch1-1 ...
  
pacman -Q
  
5.17.1.arch1-1
  
Last time I updated I gave up trying to fix it because only kernel downgrade worked. Today I tried to update it again since I hoped it would be fixed by update, like the first time, but that didn&#x27;t happen.
 I&#x27;m also using LVM on Luks if this is important.
 Does anyone have any ideas what else I can try or where else can I look for solution? Anyway thanks for reading.

 Can&#x27;t really downgrade glibc to test my hypothesis, can I?

 Looks to be related to optimus-manager and/or the nvidia drivers under Linux 5.17.x
 Basically bricks the system, thankfully I&#x27;ve got timeshift to save my butt - this is a work system after all.
 I&#x27;ve done the same update on a desktop not using nvidia-optimus and it&#x27;s running perfectly fine but the laptop really doesn&#x27;t like it...

                              <span>So I&#x27;m admittedly a Gentoo user, and not an Arch user, but I am reasonably knowledgeable about Firefox, its configuration and development, particularly on Linux.
 Accordingly, I wanted to create an account to contribute to the distro agnostic info on Firefox, however, I ran into issues with the captcha. The main issue is that there is advice on the page that is out of date and is breaking people&#x27;s Firefox that needs to be amended. I&#x27;ve now dealt with multiple users in /r/firefox who have followed advice on the archwiki and run into this same problem.
 As I&#x27;m sure you all know, the captcha requires the output of a pacman command to be run. I understand this is intended to keep the wiki arch-focused, however, at least a significant portion of the wiki is used by the Linux community as a whole and is distro-agnostic. It seems absurd to put up significant barriers in this way, and only serves to lessen the likelihood of the provision of quality documentation for everyone. 
 In my view, to just say use the LiveISO, a docker image, install arch, build pacman from source, go hunting for an overlay, or use an online emulator is not a real answer, as people tend to contribute their in spare time, which may be fleeting, causing them to abandon contributing at all.
 Overall, I&#x27;m sympathetic to the aim of the captcha, but think it is doing more harm than good. What do you all think? I&#x27;ll continue attempting to contribute, but is there not some way the output of a more distro-agnostic command could be used?

I can see the value of bashrc, .bashrc, vim configs, ranger configs, rc.local. And I am only in the &quot;Oh I get it&quot; stage with this. Now I am wondering about/realizing that I should make some of the launchers from kde settings aliases in my bashrc so when I port them elsewhere it is all setup. Or are there kde shortcuts stored on a different config I should backup? I&#x27;m sure as I thing about this differently there will be more &quot;ooo&quot; i gotta take that with me too configs. It&#x27;s the cool thing about a journey all the new things to find/try.
 TL:DR. . . . Title says it all. . . .I&#x27;d love to hear and learn.

                              <span>Hey. Since the upgrade to Gnome 42 my window capture is broken. But this only affects OBS, Discord and other programs just capture things fine in wayland.
 I can select PipeWire as a capture method. And it also sees the windows, but if I select any of them the preview is just gray.

 Im using latest Nvidia 510 drivers and the zen kernel. I also installed xdg-desktop-portal and xdg-desktop-portal-gnome. OBS (27.2.4) is from flatpak (also tried the one from official repo)
 EDIT: Just saw that journalctl reports
 gnome-shell\[38192\]: Invalid buffer data
 Has anyone encountered this?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Don’t you hate it when you get a shiny new computer, and you find it to be full of programs you don’t want or need (or what we call bloatware)? The manufacturer added these programs to your computer to promote their apps or the apps of their partners. They waste space on your hard drive, appear on your Start menu, and sometimes they can run in the background and slow down your PC.
    
You can remove bloatware from Windows 10 or Windows 11 and free up space. Be aware, though, that major Windows updates tend to reinstall them anyway, so you may find yourself battling against that. 
    
Luckily, we’ve put together a list of different ways to get rid of bloatware and unwanted applications. Here they are!

                              <span>AMD is one of the behemoths of graphics on PC. Granted, Nvidia is miles ahead in terms of actual sales, but if you want great value for the money and comparable performance, then AMD could be the way to go.

                              <span>Discord is a VoIP platform that allows you to communicate with people through video and voice conferencing, as well as instant messaging. In addition, Discord also allows you to send and receive different file types, and setup and view live broadcasts. Essentially, the platform functions like TeamSpeak.
    
Discord’s community lives on different servers with several channels inside each. These channels can be for different games, internet personalities, interests, etc.
    
However, Discord is popular among gamers who play titles that require constant and real-time communication. Players of competitive multiplayer games such as Counter Strike: Global Offensive, CSGO, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, and Call of Duty: Warzone use Discord to communicate with other players.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve noticed that debootstrap, dpkg, and the liquorix kernel are all available from the Arch Repos.
 My first thought was; &quot;Why not just install a Deb based system?&quot; And then I remembered; this is the Arch way.
 I&#x27;m quite intrigued by this conjecture.
 Is it possible to get a mostly debian based setup using the packages for Debian? 
 Does dpkg replace pacman, or work independently for Just a debian based Arch Install?

                              <span>just wanted to post this here cause it took me a while to find the solution to my black screen problem after login.
 problem: black screen with cursor, able to open up krunner to open windows, no windows manager at all
 I thought I had a KDE Plasma issue. I read posts about uninstalling all KDE git packages and reinstalling non-git ones, but I found no git ones installed. then when I realized it was a KWin problem, I saw that I had kwin-low-latency installed instead of kwin
 solution: install kwin instead of kwin-low-latency
 tl;dr -- IF YOU HAVE KWIN-LOW-LATENCY, REPLACE WITH KWIN!

Can arch work properly on the mac mini? What extra steps would i need to take to set it up (the macos on it is way too slow and buggy?)

 im trying to get jupyther notebooks working with VSCode code package.
 i installed the code package and conda to manage python and have the jupyther notebook extension enabled but there are some weird errors happening
 Extension &#x27;ms-toolsai.jupyter CANNOT USE these API proposals &#x27;notebookConcatTextDocument, notebookControllerKind, notebookDebugOptions, notebookDeprecated, notebookEditor, notebookEditorDecorationType, notebookEditorEdit, notebookMessaging, notebookMime, notebookCellExecutionState, portsAttributes, textDocumentNotebook, quickPickSortByLabel&#x27;. You MUST start in extension development mode or use the --enable-proposed-api command line flag 
 am i missing something?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to enable zstd compression on a single subvolume (out of five). I&#x27;d like all other subvolumes to be mounted without any compression.
  
When I mount all the subvolumes without compression, they&#x27;re mounted that way.
 When I mount even a single subvolume with compression enabled (compress&#x3D;zstd:1), all subvolumes are mounted with compression enabled.
  
Is that something which &quot;must be&quot; and is that how btrfs subvolumes work? Thank you.

                              <span>I wanted to add couple more arguments to MPV so i copied it&#x27;s desktop file from /usr/share/applications to ~/.local/share/applications and did my alterations to Exec. It worked, but now, for some reason, it is no longer the default application for anything. Or, more specifically, things like file managers no longer see it as such, however xdg-open still opens the files without issues and xdg-mime query default video/x-matroska still reports mpv.desktop.
 I tried removing the MIME part of the override&#x27;s desktop file and removing the original file from usr, under the assumptions i might have made it ambiguous - nothing fixes it, except removing my override altogether.
 I&#x27;m not entirely sure what causes it, since it works with the xdg tools perfectly fine. I checked ArchWiki&#x27;s entries for XDG Desktop and MIME but there wasn&#x27;t anything about this issue. Thoughts?
 (inb4 - i don&#x27;t use a DE so i can&#x27;t just look up defaults in GUI there)
 UPD: Ok, i think i figured it out: i needed to run update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications. I guess that was on me since i go used to rofi picking up desktop entries by itself without needing to manually update the database, and for assuming that running the command by itself would try to update the current user&#x27;s database, not the one in /usr/.
 Still no idea why presence of mpv.desktop in the local applications nullifies the MIME associations for it already present in the /usr/ though

                              <span>During the winter, I decided to start mining xmr to heat up my room. I had just repurposed my old computer into a server that was just sitting there doing nothing, and I decided to let it go ham on mining. The temperature started to warm up again. Therefore, I stopped mining.
 ​
 All of a sudden, I am having stability problems left and right with my server. I&#x27;ve updated the bios, left it on default settings (which unfortunately means I&#x27;m running 2133Mhz on 3200Mhz ddr4). Cleared cmos. Everything!!!
 ​
 I decided to let it start mining, and voila! stable. It&#x27;s been up 3 days without a freeze whereas before it would only go 40 minutes without hard freezing.
 ​
 Advice would be appreciated. FYI, i just ran the server quickstart in the archinstall script.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve updated my system few weeks ago and I can&#x27;t use my network card (wifi + bluetooth) since then. It&#x27;s unblocked inside rfkill, but I can&#x27;t see it inside nmcli. I have the newest version of linux-firmware and linux installed. I can&#x27;t seem to find any issues inside journalctl, but inside dmesg | grep wifi this shows up:
 [ 1.566907] iwlwifi 0000:00:14.3: enabling device (0000 -&gt; 0002) [ 1.568255] iwlwifi 0000:00:14.3: Can find a correct rfid for crf id 0x816 [ 1.568273] iwlwifi: probe of 0000:00:14.3 failed with error -22 
 ​
 I couldn&#x27;t find the solution on internet, so if someone knows why is this happening, please tell me.

                              <span>The interactive mode of aspell is not showing most accent and symbols. This error is either in the text part and the suggestions section. For example the phrase:&quot;Existe um longo histórico de erros técnicos&quot; print as &quot;Existe um longo hist rico de erros t cnicos&quot;.
 This is not a font, bash, or terminal emulator problem. vim and others parts of the terminal, the accents are printed just fine.
 The packages aspell, the dictionary aspell-pt are up do date.
 One yer ago aspell was working in portuguese and english texts, since then there have been NO updates in this packages, so I suspect that this issue is caused by and update on some aspell dependence.
 Aspell is correcting the words correctly, the only issue is not printing characters with portuguese accents.

                              <span>This is a battle between me and my system; so far the system is winning.
 I have what I suspect is a standard setup with ALSA and PulseAudio, with Jack for help in playing MIDI files. I&#x27;d like to replace PulseAudio with Pipewire, but attempts to add any Pipewire packages leads to conflicts with PulseAudio, which I can&#x27;t remove as it&#x27;s needed for something else... and so on.
 Last week I could use speakertest in the terminal, and also play MP3 files using mpg123. Today - remarkably enough - I can still play MP3 files, but I can&#x27;t use speakertest; I get an error that 
 Unable to set hw params for playback: Cannot allocate memory 
 Setting of hwparams failed: Cannot allocate memory
 Well, I can live without speakertest. At least I can play MP3s.
 What I can&#x27;t do though, is get any sound from my browser with streaming services like YouTube. And this is constant across all browsers; at least the ones I&#x27;ve tried. (Chrome, Firefox, Vivaldi.)
 But surely, getting sound working shouldn&#x27;t be that hard? All I want is for sound to, you know, work. It&#x27;s crazy that it&#x27;s as difficult and as non-intuitive as it seems to be.
 Anyway, if anybody has any bright ideas about how to manage sound (my machine is a Lenovo X1 Carbon 3rd generation), I&#x27;d be thrilled.

 When the battery enters a fully-charged state, the status is reported as Unknown. Is this a case where I am missing a package necessary for the battery status to be reported properly? Web searches showed several similar issues, but they all seemed to involve batteries that refused to charge. In my case, the battery appears to be working fine. Additionally, the status is correctly reported as Discharging when unplugged, and Charging when charging. It&#x27;s only when the battery gets full that it starts showing Unknown.

                              <span>im trying to install arch on my laptop with alongside windows. i used Archfi manual partitioning each OS has its own EFI partitionin (i tried on the same EFI part but that almost nuked my whole drive) after i was done installing i reboot and i cant see an entry for the syatem i just installed. only windows. i even tried to add a grubx64.efi entry to the windows boot maneger but i cant find it... ill attach a photo of the whole filesystem tree of the EFI directory from a windows program.
 im just at a loss. i tried multiple different distros to no avail. the only thing the bios can see is windows.
 my setup: Lenovo Legion 5, Ryzen 7 5800H, RTX 3050, 16Gb Ram, 512Gb NVME SSD, Windows 11.

                              <span>I dont know where else too post this so here we go. I set up an wireguard server with pivpn on an orangepi pc. Also tried it manually but with the same result. The server works like it should, I can connect to it from my smartphone or my laptop. On my laptop I imported the wireguard config in network manager. Everything works as expected, it even automatically connects to the VPN after suspend or hibernate and also after disabling and reenabling WiFi in the gnome settings. However as soon as I switch to an different WiFi network NetworkManager goes complete nuts. The nmcli command line program as well as the gnome network settings become completely unresponsive. While I can ping IP addresses with ping and resolve hostnames with nslookup no websites load and trace route gets stuck after some hops. Rebooting fixes the issue. Neighter dmesg nor journalctl give any relevant info, they behave like nothing happened except for ah coredump when gnome-settings crashes. I tried some of the dns related stuff in the wiki like the systemd-resolved symlink or using openresolv but that didn&#x27;t change a thing. I honestly have no idea where to take it from here. Maybe someone knows what&#x27;s wrong. 
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>When using Windows, you’ll notice that it comes with its own antivirus called Windows Defender (now called Windows Security in later versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11). For some, Windows Defender is more of a hindrance than a help. As such, they’ll want to disable Windows Defender completely. As you’ll discover in this tutorial, disabling Windows Defender isn’t as easy as it should be. Regardless, making sure Defender goes down and stays down isn’t very tricky at all.

                              <span>If you have tried to dual boot your Windows system with Linux, then you probably encountered some changes that may not be welcome. When installing Linux in this environment, the GRUB bootloader will overwrite the Windows bootloader within the Master Boot Record (MBR).
    
This is also true in reverse: If you have installed Linux first and then decide to install Windows, the Windows bootloader will overwrite GRUB. You will then find that there is no way to boot into your Linux Desktop.
    
Lastly, any major change in Windows can also modify your bootloader rendering it unusable. This is the case for the Anniversary Update in Windows 10 and the Windows 11 upgrade.
    
Any of these scenarios can be problematic for the new user, but thankfully with a little patience and care, there are ways to restore the bootloader, and in the process, repair the MBR.

                              <span>Questa settimana Microsoft festeggia ben 30 anni dal rilascio della versione finale di Windows 3.1, una versione importante dell&#x27;&#x27;ambiente operativo&#x27;, molto più di quanto non suggerisca la numerazione a suo tempo utilizzata: &#x27;3.1&#x27; fa pensare a una &#x27;release minore&#x27; piuttosto che a un rilascio in grande stile.Abbiamo scritto &#x27;ambiente operativo&#x27; perché all&#x27;epoca Windows non era ancora un sistema operativo vero e proprio: si presentava come un&#x27;interfaccia grafica da caricarsi al di sopra di MS-DOS o di PC DOS.Microsoft rilasciò Windows 3.1 a inizio aprile 1992, solo due anni dopo l&#x27;arrivo di Windows 3.0. Il predecessore di Windows 3.1 fu accolto positivamente dall&#x27;industria e dagli utenti finali ma mancava di componenti chiave, soffriva di tanti difetti (bug), usava font bitmap e veniva espressamente presentato come una sorta di add-on per MS-DOS.Rendendosi conto della necessità di rimanere competitivi con i Mac di Apple e in vista del salto ai 32 bit con il successivo Windows 95, Microsoft aveva assolutamente necessità di stringere i tempi e rilasciare Windows 3.1 nel più breve tempo possibile.</span>

                              <span>Unity è un motore grafico multipiattaforma che facilita lo sviluppo di videogiochi e di altri contenuti interattivi: si pensi a visualizzazioni architettoniche e animazioni 3D in tempo reale.Non ha bisogno di presentazioni: nella versione standard è completamente gratuito (si possono realizzare progetti commerciali senza pagare il software, a patto di avere un giro d&#x27;affari inferiore a 100.000 dollari) ed è stato utilizzato da centinaia di aziende per realizzare progetti di successo.Gli sviluppatori apprezzano Unity per via delle API di scripting C# e dell&#x27;integrazione con Visual Studio direttamente supportata. È inoltre possibile usare JavaScript come linguaggio di scripting e MonoDevelop come IDE per coloro che vogliono un&#x27;alternativa a Visual Studio.Quasi tutto può essere animato con Unity: i creatori di contenuti e gli artisti se ne servono per creare scene 3D o costruire animazioni 2D da zero. Poiché Unity esiste ormai dal 2005 ha potuto raccogliere un enorme seguito di utenti in tutti questi anni e portare a maturazione un&#x27;incredibile libreria di risorse.
