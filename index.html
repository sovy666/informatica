                              <span>Generally, Google Play Services is preinstalled on all Android phones. But if you’ve rooted your phone, installed a custom ROM, or own one of the few Android phones that don’t come with Google’s ecosystem baked into them, then you probably don’t have Google Play Services installed. As long as your Android phone isn’t ancient, you should be able to download and install Google Play Services on your Android phone by following the steps below.

                              <span>I switched to arch from ubuntu because of all the extra fluff it has. I used airblader’s i3-gaps wm (I’m looking to switch to bspwm for arch linux) and used polybar for a taskbar. I don’t think I have any need for a desktop environment, since I don’t need a “bundle” of stuff if I can somehow assemble all the individual parts I need together. 
 Are there alternatives to a desktop environment? I’m not sure exactly how I can get a gui to work without one. What other parts do I need? Guides seem scarce as it seems most people just install Gnome. 
 This is new ground for me. Sorry if I sound like a noob right now. Any help would be appreciated!

                              <span>Everything was working fine until I decided to try to play the original Colonization game on steam. When i tried to run it my monitors went black with an &quot;out of range&quot; message on it and it persists after rebooting. The SDDM animation displays as normal on boot but then when I&#x27;d normally get to the KDE desktop i get the black screens again. I was able to hear Firefox start playing a video due to random luck pressing buttons during the black screen, so i&#x27;m sure its running I think its just stuck in a display setting that isn&#x27;t working.
 I&#x27;ve tried editing the kernel parameters and adding nomodeset, also tried specifying the resolution and refresh rate of my monitor there and it doesn&#x27;t help. I&#x27;ve tried unplugging and plugging the monitors, booting with just one monitor connected, none of it has made a difference. Any suggestions on how to get back to my desktop? I&#x27;m using systemdboot and X11 if that makes any difference. Thanks.
 Edit: Finally fixed it. Booted with the kernel parameter 3 in order to boot to the command line and deleted everything in ~/.local/share/kscreen
 Now working after a reboot.

 If I play the music file an image shows up in mpv or vlc so i know the metadata is there. 
 Is it a configuration thing or a plugin thing? 
 I was hoping ranger_devicons-git would do it but it doesn&#x27;t seem so.

                              <span>Just learned that I need to configure hibernation and Suspend on My Laptop.
 Wondering if you could provide some tips or pointers?
 My goal is to read through the Wiki for both power management and Hybrid setup. I&#x27;m trying to determine ahead of time what tools I might need.
 I&#x27;m running the mainline, upstream kernel (5.17), with btrfs (Post 5.0), and KDE with Powerdevil installed. What other tools might I require? acpid? laptop-mode-tools? any Gui?
 Can I set this up with GUI only? 
 Is there anything to be aware of when configuring? 
 What tools do you recommend?
 My laptop is Asus FA506IU Ryzen 4800H and 1660ti.
 Thanks in advance

 But there is some questions.

 Is there in the repo yet?

                              <span>My school has a Surface Pro 3 that I&#x27;m installing arch on for the students. The install went well, but I&#x27;m having a problem with the wifi that I can&#x27;t solve. I&#x27;ve tried every fix I can find, but there are still no wifi networks showing.
 ip link just shows the lo device
 rfkill list just returns and shows no devices
 lspci -k shows the following:
 01:00.0 Ethernet controller: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. 88W8897 [AVASTAR] 802.11ac Wireless Subsystem: SafeNet (wrong ID) Device 045e Kernel driver in use: mwifiex_pcie Kernel modules: mwifiex_pcie 
 Any ideas on where to go from here? The wifi worked during installation using iwctl

                              <span>Installed the wacom drivers, and tried to set up my key-binds on my wacom tablet, and for some reason the GUI slowly gets bigger and escapes the screen, also the first key in the bottom row of buttons has its &quot;select key-bind&quot; text box right on the edge of my screen and it disappears whenever I type something so I straight up cannot bind it.

                              <span>I find that a lot of new-ish Arch and especially Arch-derivative-distro users, are not aware of and have no idea how or why they need to handle .pacnew / .pacsve files. (Arch Wiki: (1) system mainteance (2) Pacnew / Pacsave)
 I find when I try to explain what these files are, why its important to care, and why users are expected to promptly deal with them as part of routine system maintenance in an Arch based rolling distro, people&#x27;s eyes glaze over (probably has something to do with my use of exciting terms like &quot;routine system maintenance&quot; 😉)
 Does anyone have a good resource or good elevator pitch length explanation of what they are and why its important for Arch users to care.

                              <span>There is a known issue with the mt7921e driver that causes it to sometimes fail to load after a reboot/default shutdown command. The patch is live in the mainline kernel so I&#x27;d rather wait than recompile it myself, but for the time being I&#x27;ve been holding the power button down on my laptop to forcibly kill the power. Obviously this is less than ideal, so I was wondering what the safest way to perform this kind of power cycle is, short of removing the battery.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently under restrictive firewall in my school. I use the web through Psiphon since it&#x27;s the only proxy/tunnel that works in this network.
 The network admin recently blocked outgoing traffic on port 22. So I can&#x27;t access Git repos through ssh. I couldn&#x27;t get it to use Psiphon&#x27;s localhost socks proxy.
 For Github I ended up following this guide to use the ssh.github.com:443 endpoint instead of github.com:22. https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/troubleshooting-ssh/using-ssh-over-the-https-port
 Is there something similar for AUR ssh? Are there any alternatives?

                              <span>Hello, was looking to install arch with btrfs (currently have ext4). I have read the btrfs wiki and some guides on youtube/the internet in general. I have seen people creating subvolumes at \@log, \@snapshots, and/or \@pkg for pacman packages. Can someone explain to me the thought process behind these subvolumes or point me to some recourses explaining it?
 Thank you

                              <span>I have a PC with two m.2 ssds. 1TB for Windows, and 500GB for arch. I plan to upgrade my arch ssd to 2TB. How do you guys will do it? I&#x27;m open to suggestion. Clean install is completely okay, but I want to explore other options/tools too.

                              <span>So I had to reinstall my bootloader after upgrading the motherboard. Okay, no problem. I grabbed my Arch Linux thumb drive and booted the live environment only to find my PC speaker blasting some noise that I later recognized as Pacman&#x27;s theme music. For a second I almost got a mini heart attack thinking that something was wrong with the motherboard. NOT COOL Arch team.

                              <span>The beeping script created by u/alex19ep is extracted directly from 2022-04-01 iso, with its path changed to /usr/bin/pacman-beep.sh. 
 You can play it as many times as your want, as long as you have a pc speaker on your motherboard. 🤣 
 There&#x27;s two hooks running before and after every transaction, meaning it will be played before and after any time you install/update packages. 
 You could, in theory, replace your pacman binary with a custom script so you can play that EVERY TIME YOU RUN PACMAN.🤣 
 https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pacman-beep-hook. 
 Edit: The set up permission error is raised by beep when pacman is runned as root with sudo, but the hook erroring does not stop any installation/upgrading, the package is installed successfully anyway. 
 According to @EmbarrassedActive4, beep will refuse to work if you run pacman with sudo, you can simply run pacman as root or su -c &#x27;pacman&#x27; to su to root and execute pacman in one go.

                              <span>Hey, I am a cybersecurity student and I want to learn about ArchLinux, the problem is that I use several programs that, from what I have seen, only run on windows, such as microsft programs and FilmForth (my video editor from preference).
 What I want to achieve with this is to know the opinions that the most experienced people have about this change of operating system and, above all, to know if there is any way to continue using these programs without the need for a virtual box.
 Thanks so much for reading ;)

                              <span>Creare una immagine fasulla di una persona, che sembra assolutamente reale, non richiede grandi sforzi o programmi particolari, basta fare qualche ricerca su Internet e ci sono vari siti, come This person does not exist.com che generano una immagine in pochi secondi. Queste immagini “AI generate” possono poi essere usate, per esempio, in un sito di incontri per spacciarsi per una persona reale di bell’aspetto e tentare qualche truffa. Mi è così capitato di provare l’estensione, disponibile solo per Chrome e i browser basati su Chromium, Fake Profile Detector, sviluppata da V7 Labs, che è in grado di riconoscere le immagini fasulle generate usando il metodo StyleGAN. Al momento non è in grado di riconoscere fotomontaggi o video fasulli. Per maggiori informazioni potete vedere una dimostrazione del funzionamento dell’estensione in un video, in inglese, di Alberto Rizzoli, uno dei fondatori di V7 Lab.

                              <span>Manhattan, azienda leader nello sviluppo di soluzioni tecnologicamente avanzate, presenta il nuovo cavo adattatore USB Type-C HDMI utile per collegare agevolmente dispositivi come smartphone, tablet e computer dotati di porta USB-C con uno schermo, monitor o proiettore HDMI senza richiedere l&#x27;utilizzo di un adattatore aggiuntivo. La soluzione proposta da Manhattan permette una connessione diretta, ordinata e professionale tra dispositivi ed è quindi ideale per l&#x27;home office, l&#x27;home theater e per qualunque situazione in cui vi sia l&#x27;esigenza di trasferire il segnale audio-video in modo semplice e veloce.Disponibile nelle lunghezze da 1 metro (modello IUSBC-HDMI-4-010) e da 2 metri (modello IUSBC-HDMI-4-020), il cavo adattatore da USB-C a HDMI di Manhattan supporta risoluzioni UHD (Ultra High-Definition) fino a 4K (3840 x 2160 pixel) a 60 Hz garantendo immagini ultra nitide e realistiche, senza sfocature o artefatti, con una qualità audio e video eccellenti.

Il versatile adattatore proposto da Manhattan è compatibile con qualsiasi dispositivo USB-C che supporta la funzionalità DisplayPort Alt Mode inclusi smartphone, Apple MacBook, Chromebook, Pixel e tablet.A differenza della maggior parte degli altri cavi DP Alt Mode che supportano solo 30 fps, il prodotto di Manhattan assicura prestazioni ai massimi livelli permettendo di gestire un frame rate fino a 60 fps, ideale quindi anche per il segmento gaming.La circuiteria utilizzata per il cavo adattatore è compatibile con la tecnologia Thunderbolt 3 e si mette in evidenza per la struttura a doppia schermatura a lamina e treccia in grado di ridurre al minimo le interferenze elettromagnetiche (EMI) così come tutte le altre fonti di interferenza.</span>

                              <span>Tor è un insieme di protocolli che ambiscono ad assicurare anonimato, privacy e resistenza alla censura su Internet. Tor è anche un programma scritto in C che implementa i protocolli sia lato client che lato server.Nella nostra guida a Tor Browser abbiamo spiegato come funziona Tor e come la rete possa essere utilizzate anche per navigare anonimi.Il progetto Tor ha preso forma nel 2002 utilizzando come base i lavori in tema di Onion Routing della metà degli anni &#x27;90. Dal 2006 lo sviluppo di Tor è gestito da un ente senza scopo di lucro ed è cresciuto di anno in anno fino ad essere scelto ogni giorno da milioni di utenti in tutto il mondo.Oggi la comunità di sviluppo di Tor ha annunciato che entro settembre 2022 dovrebbe debuttare la prima versione stabile di Arti, un client non più scritto in C bensì in Rust.Rust è un linguaggio di programmazione compilato sviluppato da Mozilla Research in collaborazione con la comunità open source il cui obiettivo primario è quello di consentire la realizzazione di sistemi complessi altamente sicuri, anche multithreaded.L&#x27;attuale client multipiattaforma di Tor non morirà a breve ma in futuro verrà certamente accantonato.</span>

                              <span>Quando si naviga sul Web qualunque browser aggiorna la cronologia ovvero l&#x27;elenco delle pagine che vengono via via consultate dall&#x27;utente.Ci è stato chiesto come cancellare gli ultimi minuti della cronologia del browser per evitare, ad esempio, che un altro utente possa sapere cosa si è cercato di recente e quali attività si sono svolte sul Web.Premettiamo che è possibile cancellare la cronologia dell&#x27;ultima ora mentre per il momento i browser Web non consentono di eliminare ad esempio i dati relativi agli ultimi 5, 10, 15 o 30 minuti di navigazione.Partiamo però da un assunto importante: quando si naviga sul Web o si utilizza un qualunque dispositivo ciascun utente dovrebbe sempre servirsi di un account di sua esclusiva pertinenza.Chi possiede un account dotato di privilegi amministrativi può comunque accedere alla cronologia del browser degli altri account utente. Esistono software gratuiti come BrowsingHistoryView che recuperano la cronologia di qualunque browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Chromium e derivati) per qualsiasi account configurato su una macchina locale o remota.Per evitare di far sapere agli altri utenti cosa si sta cercando, si dovrebbe quindi usare sempre la navigazione in incognito del browser: in questo modo le pagine Web visitate e tutti gli elementi in esse presenti non saranno memorizzate né a livello di cronologia né di cache locale.Per &#x27;spaccare il capello&#x27; ed evitare che altri soggetti possano risalire agli URL dei siti Web visitati anche nella modalità di navigazione in incognito è possibile attivare l&#x27;uso del protocollo DNS over HTTPS (DoH) che provvede a crittografare tutte le richieste di risoluzione dei nomi a dominio.</span>

                              <span>Nelle nostre pagine parliamo spesso di applicazioni e servizi smart nati da startup italiane con un grande potenziale. Semplificare la complessità del software e snellire i flussi di lavoro è la stella polare verso la quale si cerca di puntare ormai in tutti i settori.Non è facile, però, intervenire sul miglioramento della gestione dei processi se non si dispone degli strumenti giusti.Prendiamo i software per la gestione cantieri: ce ne sono tanti in giro ma non sono molti a centrare l&#x27;obiettivo. Mela è un&#x27;app che ambisce a &#x27;semplificare il complesso&#x27; attraverso una tecnologia digitale facile e intuitiva, mobile, pensata per chi lavora ogni giorno sul campo.Il settore dell&#x27;edilizia è invecchiato in termini di mentalità, strumenti e manodopera (gli operai con meno di 30 anni sono l&#x27;11%) ma allo stesso tempo è in forte espansione (PNRR, superbonus,...).Mela si propone quindi come un&#x27;app dedicata a chi opera nel settore delle costruzioni e ristrutturazioni, imprese edili, impiantisti, studi tecnici e liberi professionisti, direttori lavori, coordinatori della sicurezza e facility manager.</span>

                              <span>Gli utenti hanno segnalato in questi giorni un problema con i nuovi driver Adrenalin: una volta installati modificano la configurazione del BIOS all&#x27;insaputa degli utenti provocando di fatto l&#x27;overclocking delle CPU Ryzen.AMD ha confermato il problema descrivendolo come un bug sul quale i tecnici dell&#x27;azienda stanno indagando. La società guidata da Lisa Su ha aggiunto che fornirà maggiori informazioni sulla questione &#x27;il più presto possibile&#x27;.Il bug interessa soltanto i computer con una scheda grafica Radeon e un processore Ryzen: questi ultimi sono controllati tramite il software Adrenalin che integra una sorta di modulo software (Ryzen Master) utilizzato per modificare vari aspetti del funzionamento del processore senza dover entrare nel BIOS.Il tutto è governato dalla funzione chiamate Precision Boost Overdrive (PBO) che si occupa di regolare tensioni e frequenze &#x27;al volo&#x27; per l&#x27;overclock con un semplice clic.L&#x27;overclocking automatico del processore causato dall&#x27;installazione del driver Adrenalin più aggiornato non è di per sé un grosso problema perché l&#x27;aumento delle frequenze operative appare piuttosto contenuto.</span>

                              <span>Aumentare la dimensione di un&#x27;immagine porta inevitabilmente a una perdita di qualità quando si lavora con le foto e in generale in grafica raster/bitmap.Un ridimensionamento con il conseguente aumento della risoluzione introduce il ben noto effetto &#x27;sgranato&#x27; con la qualità dell&#x27;immagine che cala verticalmente.In un altro articolo abbiamo visto come ingrandire le immagini senza perdere qualità.Gli sviluppatori di Topaz Labs hanno presentato GigaPixel 6.0, la più recente versione della loro tecnologia che permette di effettuare il cosiddetto upscaling.L&#x27;upscaling è il processo tramite il quale un&#x27;immagine con una determinata risoluzione viene convertita a una risoluzione maggiore ed è ampiamente utilizzato in ambito multimediale.

Gigapixel AI aiuta a fare bene una sola cosa ovvero aumentare la risoluzione delle immagini in modo naturale.</span>

 could this be because the theme.lua(config.lua in my case :D) has a forbidden name or is missing a mandatory argument?
 ​
 Edit: my theme.lua was incomplete so it could not be read.

                              <span>Hello all,
 Posting this Firefox problem on r/Arch because that is the only instance where I experience this problem. That said, it may not be an Arch problem at all, but I had to start somewhere.
 ​
 The problem is that Firefox freezes frequently, and for sevaral seconds at a time, on one of my PCs. Active tab is frozen, and can&#x27;t switch to any other. After several seconds a tab responds, and makes FF essentially useless. This happens only on one machine.
 ​
 I run Firefox on KDE. I have three instances:
 - Arch vfio VM w/nvidia
 - Fedora Spin vfio VM with custom repo for kde latest, w/nvidia
 - Arch on System76 laptop w/intel/nvida, using Optimus Manager in hybrid mode
 ​
 The two VMs are configured the same with all respects except for OS. I only run one or the other at a time. There are no tweaks applied to Firefox on any instance other than add-ons.
 ​
 The VMs are my daily drivers, and ideally it would be the Arch VM. But since Firefox is unusable essentially on that VM,I am using Fedora until I can solve this problem.
 ​
 Things that I have tried on the Arch VM:
 - reviewed the Arch Wiki entry for solutions
 - Safe mode
 - clear clache
 - move cache to ramdisk
 - create new profile
 - Remove FF and ~/.mozilla and /.cache/mozilla directories, reinstall and create a, new profile.
 After each of these changes, the freezing problem always returned at some point.
 ​
 I am out of ideas. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Hi all:
 I sat down at my Arch desktop to find it near unusable last night. I upgraded packages on Sunday, but I didn&#x27;t reboot the machine until the next morning (Monday morning). One of the things that was updated was the NVIDIA driver to 510.60.02 from 510.54. I believe this to be the culprit because I&#x27;ve read others are having issues with this driver, but I&#x27;ve downgraded all my NVIDIA packages (&quot;nvidia&quot;, &quot;nvidia-utils&quot;, lib32-nvidia-utils&quot;) back to the version before 510.60.2, and the issue persists.
 My machine sports an i7-6700, GTX 1070, 16GB RAM on an SSD. I&#x27;ve been running the 5.17.1 kernel since the day it was released in the main repo and was using the machine without incident until last night/upgrade on Sunday -- I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an issue with the new kernel. I have never had …</span>

                              <span>SOLVED: The printer IP address isn&#x27;t a sufficient Device URI. One must provide the full path of the printer&#x27;s listening endpoint. In the case of the Epson ET-3760, it&#x27;s ipp://${printer_ip_address}/ipp/print.
  
I&#x27;ve got an Epson ET-3760 that I&#x27;ve set up with the AUR epson-inkjet-printer-escpr2 package. It&#x27;s online. I can connect to it via my web browser and the MATE Print Settings show me the correct ink levels. Yet I cannot print a test page or anything else from any application. The only error in /var/log/cups/error_log is an extremely useful and specific one-liner E [05/Apr/2022:13:23:25 -0700] [Job 8] Print job was not accepted. only with the job number and time changing with each attempt. I can print from any other device in the house, so I must be doing something wrong and I don&#x27;t know what.

 Is there a player in the archiverse that I can easily achieve this with using command line arguments?

                              <span>I would consider myself a fairly sophisticated user, but I&#x27;m out of my depth here when it comes to kernel diagnostics.
 I am having random system crashes on startx, and sometimes on resume from suspend, and sometimes just during boot, but I don&#x27;t know how to see what is happening or causing them. Also sometimes getting RO filesystem type crashes that may or may not be related.
 I&#x27;ve been doing the following:
 journalctl -b -r -p 1..4 &gt; errors.md and looking for an insertion point for troubleshooting, but it&#x27;s hard to say what is critical and what isn&#x27;t without some deeper knowledge of how the kernel is working / supposed to work.
 Dell Precision 5550 only has USB-C inputs and most of the errors are not reproducible in some way that lends itself to easy diagnostics. I updated the BIOS last week and everything is up to date, but the crashes persist and instability persists, especially when there are devices connected to the USB-C ports.
 Is there somewhere else to look or something to be done before I just RMA the machine and use a desktop instead? Really some description of the process is what I&#x27;m looking for more than just &quot;the answer&quot;, which I&#x27;m happy to put in the foot miles to get. I&#x27;ll put the output of the journal log in the comments.
 I would think it was something I&#x27;m doing wrong except these problems sometimes happen during POST and I get multiple sequential reboots even before drive decrypt which makes me think I&#x27;ve got a hardware/firmware problem.

                              <span>I updated last night and after I enter my LUKS key before KDE loads the following is displayed which did not appear prior to updating:
  
 libbpf: failed to find valid kernel BTF
 libbpf: Error loading vmllinux BTF: -3
 libbpf: failed to load object &#x27;iterators_bpf&#x27;
 libbpf: failed to load BPF skeleton &#x27;iterators_bpf&#x27; -3
 Failed load could be due to wrong endianness 
  
 I used the search here and no results so far. I did see someone talk about it on the Arch forums but the fix did not work for me. 
 https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id&#x3D;262019
 https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/69155
 &quot;Disabling CONFIG_BPF_PRELOAD gets rid of those warnings. It seems to be a debug related option so disabling it makes sense while CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO is disabled at the same time.&quot;

For example, does it include network manager or systemd-networkd? Does it use resolved? What things have to be installed on top of Arch to get a system I don&#x27;t have to fiddle around with like Fedora.

The first time I rebooted everything went fine but after the second boot, the first drive I added could not mount. It still showed up in the file manager but was not accessible when I tried to open it. It gave me a short error saying something went wrong and this is an unknown error when I tried to mount it myself. After a restart, everything worked fine again but after rebooting I noticed a pattern. The same drive gives the same mounting error every other time I boot my machine. The other drive never makes any issue. What&#x27;s happening?

                              <span>One of the more sensible default security features on Android devices is not allowing users to install apps from outside the Play Store. But with plenty of great apps you can find outside the Play Store, you may want to venture beyond those walls every now and then. Luckily, it’s fairly easy to install apps from unknown sources on Android.

In true Apple fashion, the AirPods require little effort to set up. Just remove them from the charging case, insert them into your ears, and they will connect automatically. It’s that easy. You’ll be listening to your favorite tunes and podcasts and taking important phone calls in seconds. Dual beamforming mics will help you take those calls. 
    

    
The Apple AirPods (2nd gen) stay connected and are always on. They turn on and off by the placement in your ears. Take them out, and they pause, reinsert them, and they’re ready to play anything.

But do you really need to use these paid services when you’re just starting out? We recommend investing in a professionally-created logo after you have landed a few clients.
    
For now, instead of paying for a logo, you can design a simple logo yourself for free using Google Drawings. We show you how to do that and the prep work you need to do.

                              <span>Microsoft spiega che la sicurezza di Windows 11 verrà significativamente migliorata con il rilascio delle prossime versioni del sistema operativo. Nuove funzionalità &#x27;inedite&#x27; aggiungeranno nuovi livelli di protezione contro le minacce, offriranno una migliore crittografia e aiuteranno a bloccare app e driver dannosi.L&#x27;obiettivo dell&#x27;azienda di Redmond è quello di combinare più livelli di protezione, dall&#x27;hardware fino al cloud.Una delle nuove caratteristiche vocate alla sicurezza che Microsoft sta inserendo in Windows 11 è una maggiore protezione contro gli attacchi phishing mirati ovvero le aggressori progettate dai criminali informatici che hanno l&#x27;obiettivo di bersagliare una singola azienda o un professionista. Il nuovo sistema antiphishing sarà integrato in Microsoft Defender SmartScreen e sarà basato sull&#x27;intelligenza derivante dal cloud.Dal momento che, come sappiamo, SmartScreen è integrato a livello di sistema operativo, gli utenti di Windows 11 saranno avvertiti quando proveranno a inserire le loro credenziali in applicazioni dannose o siti Web violati.</span>

                              <span>A metà dello scorso anno l&#x27;azienda di Redmond ha presentato Windows 365 Cloud PC, un nuovo servizio che permette di eseguire installazioni di Windows 10 e Windows 11 da un browser Web, ovunque ci si trovi.Le installazioni dei sistemi operativi si trovano nell&#x27;infrastruttura cloud di Microsoft ed è possibile usare Windows come se fosse installato sul dispositivo locale.Citrix e molte altre aziende hanno offerto per anni strumenti simili ma l&#x27;obiettivo di Microsoft è quello di estendere la platea degli utenti facendo in modo che i sistemi Windows 11 possano avviarsi utilizzando l&#x27;installazione locale oppure effettuando il boot da Windows 365 Cloud PC.Gli utenti di Windows 11 potranno passare liberamente dall&#x27;una all&#x27;altra installazione, in totale libertà.La novità presentata da Microsoft si inquadra nel ventaglio di iniziative promosse dalla società guidata da Satya Nadella per supportare le aziende che si appoggiando allo smart working.


Windows 365 Cloud PC si lega con Windows 11: ecco le tre nuove caratteristiche
 I portavoce di Microsoft spiegano che alcune nuove caratteristiche di Windows 365 saranno profondamente integrate in Windows 11.La prima si chiama Windows 365 Boot e consentirà ai dispositivi Windows 11, come accennato in precedenza, di accedere direttamente a un&#x27;istanza Cloud PC all&#x27;avvio invece di eseguire l&#x27;installazione locale del sistema operativo.Si tratta di una funzionalità progettata per i dispositivi che sono condivisi tra più persone o per le aziende che permettono ai dipendenti di portare il proprio dispositivo al lavoro (approccio BYOD, Bring your own device).Con Windows 365 Switch gli utenti potranno passare da un desktop locale a un PC Cloud senza abbandonare Windows 11.</span>

Eppure il monitor del PC è lo strumento con cui si è maggiormente a contatto, tutti i giorni: acquistare un monitor qualità significa facilitare la lettura e diminuire significativamente lo stress visivo.Scegliere un monitor per PC può però rivelarsi cosa terribilmente complicata: spesso è difficile scegliere i prodotti che meglio si adattano alle proprie esigenze e aspettative.Se avete spesso gli occhi stanchi è bene scegliere bene il monitor per PC, posizionarlo correttamente e, talvolta, fare attenzione anche all&#x27;uso di temi scuri che non sono - diversamente da quello che scrivono in tanti - la soluzione per tutti i mali.
Monitor PC: le caratteristiche del pannello
 I monitor per PC che trovate ad esempio su Amazon Italia possono utilizzare svariate tecnologie.In generale, però, si ha a che fare con monitor a pannello TFT (Thin Film Transistor) composti da un substrato di materiale semiconduttore trasparente depositato sulle superfici interne dei vetri che ospitano anche i cristalli liquidi.La specifica tecnologia utilizzabile per fabbricare il pannello del monitor può invece fare capo a diverse categorie ma generalmente i monitor per PC sono di tre tipologie: TN (Twisted Nematic), IPS (In Plane Switching) o VA (Vertical Alignment).I termini TN, IPS e VA tendono a passare inosservati tra le specifiche dei monitor quando invece la tecnologia realizzativa dei pannelli è la chiave per scegliere prodotti di qualità.
I pannelli TN
 I pannelli di tipo TN esistono da tanti anni.</span>
