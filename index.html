                              <span>Hi, I am working on a project that uses .net for the back-end. I noticed that the dot-net package has been flagged out of date for a few months now, so I don&#x27;t feel too comfortable testing it out. Does anyone have any experience developing .net on arch and is there any problem with it? Thanks.

                              <span>Hi, so this isnt my first time posting about this, but the original post was a while ago, and I recently realised the fix i said worked, did not in fact work. So my issue is that the open source drivers dont connect to my gpu. my plymouth doesnt load, and neither does gdm. i have the modules in my initramfs. They seem to be behaving as though there is no nvidia gpu in my system. i have an rtx 2060. how can i get the drivers to work with my gpu?

                              <span>I just installed arch and am trying to connect to my remote server via ssh and it is not working. I type the command in like &quot;ssh -p 8000 [me@myserver.org](mailto:me@myserver.org)&quot; and it does nothing and looks like it&#x27;s just waiting there forever, I&#x27;ve waited up to 30 minutes several times just to see if it would do anything but it doesn&#x27;t and I end up having to use ctrl+c on it. If I disconnect from my network and try it again it instantly says &quot;ssh: connect to host 0.0.27.84 port 22: Network is unreachable&quot; which is not even close to the address or port that I entered. I currently dual boot and it works in windows. I&#x27;ve searched everywhere and haven&#x27;t found any similar issues so if anyone could help or point me in the right direction, it would be very much appreciated.

 But for my game dev I need windows 10 sadly and i would like to use some of that HDD space for my game dev. So, i need to safely resize the volume such that windows can have part of the drive.

Instead of downloading the script I want to put it on the installation USB. With mkarchiso I can put the file in airootfs, but how can I do it if I&#x27;m using the regular iso?
 To change the install script would I have to rebuild the iso or is it possible to do it directly on the USB?

                              <span>So back in January I installed this so I could use my wifi dongle: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rtl8821cu-dkms-git/ Everything was working well, and then I moved back to college and started using a wired connection there. I&#x27;m back home and I&#x27;m using WiFi again, but for some reason I can&#x27;t connect to my WiFi network now. It always connected on startup before, but now it tries to connect and fails, I even deleted the saved connection and connected to it brand new, but it doesn&#x27;t work, so I&#x27;m kind of confused.

                              <span>I am posting this because I could not find the solution on Google OR the arch wiki.
 This was a super annoying bug.
 Here are easy steps to fix this.
  
Install gnome-disk-utility - sudo pacman -S gnome-disk-utility
 Install ntfs-3g - sudo pacman -S ntfs-3g
 Open gnome-disk-utility
 Select the device you would like to mount
 Select the partition you would like to mount
 There should be either a gear or triangle inside a square. Click on it. (https://i.imgur.com/gBAdsUJ.png if you need to be sure what to click)
 You should get a menu. Click &quot;Edit Mount Options&quot;
 Turn off user session defaults
 Make sure that &quot;Mount at system startup&quot; is checked/highlighted
 You can change the mount point if you want. Default is 100% fine, though.
 Click ok and enter your password
 Restart and it should now mount by default

                              <span>I see that firefox-kde was created very recently this year, and it requires different dependencies from firefox-kde-opensuse. Can we trust it? And what;s the difference between those two?

                              <span>I have installed nvidia-open-dkms and based on [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA) it should have the related udev-rule to create NVENC required device in /dev but on OBS Studio I have issue with NVENC, and it cannot find it. Also, I don&#x27;t have anything on /dev/bus/pci. Besides, I have an udev-rule under my /usr/lib for NVIDIA, which is different from the on recommend on Arch Wiki.

Also lsmod gave me -

 Does it mean my intel_agp isn&#x27;t loaded? Thank you for your precious time.

 I&#x27;ve used this Arch installatioin for a few months now (I used archinstall and chose not to use GRUB), and I think I&#x27;ve been getting more of them over time.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I have decided to take the easy way out for now and use the &#x27;archinstall&#x27; script for installing arch on my external USB SSD, I was wondering if anyone had any strong recommendations of what extra packages to install when asked with the script - so far I&#x27;m thinking definitely nano and firefox. Will be installing with Gnome and X11.
 As a side note I would like to use timeshift when setup for all the mistakes I will probably make early on, should I make a small partition on the USB SSD to save that into and if so what filesystem should it be and approx size? I am currently using an older Samsung 256GB EVO from an old build in an enclosure.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>My new printer worked fine for a few days but now suddenly it just doesn&#x27;t show up in printer options when i try to print. when i open the dialogue window the column next to the printer says &quot;waiting for printer to become available&quot;.
 ​
 But apparently if by mistake i press print then nothing happens but if i reboot and the printer is still connected then it prints the last thing i asked to print but again on startup the printer doesn&#x27;t work.(hope that made sense)
 ​
 I tried going through arch wiki and forums to see if something works but it isn&#x27;t helping.
 ​
 thank you
 ​
 I tried searching for an issue and &#x27;sudo journalctl -f&#x27; shows something when i connect the printer, it is some error with avahi

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to use appimage launcher to add rpan studio appimage to my menu system bit for some reason it&#x27;s not working. 
 OBS Studio works fine but for some reason rpan studio isn&#x27;t doing that.
 The program runs fine. I just can&#x27;t get it to show up in the menu.
 I&#x27;ve thought about using an older version but I doubt that will change anything. 
 I&#x27;m using Arch Linux with the Cinnamon desktop. Should I try KDE plasma instead?
 System specs are ThinkServer TS140. It&#x27;s pretty fast with 16gb of ram. 5tb hdd for the /home and the rest is on a 1tb ssd. This system is super fast! 
 I don&#x27;t know why it isn&#x27;t working.

                              <span>So I’ve done initial setup of arch and everything is good (I did that all with an external mouse and keyboard) but I just can’t figure out how to get the mousepad and keyboard to work. I assume that there are some missing drivers or something but my prior research has come up fruitless (unless I missed somthing very obvious) I am as you can tell very new to arch and would appreciate any help.
 Edit: I am using the newest version

 Gli Zombie sono ormai protagonisti di film e telefilm di successo ed ogni anno escono pellicole al cinema e nuove serie TV di successo (come per esempio The Walking...

                              <span>I recently tried to update my system to the new kernel, after not having updated for maybe two weeks. And upon rebooting after a completed update. I was given a grub boot error. Of an unexpected end of vmlinuz file. I tried rebuilding my mkinitcpio, but that gave me an error of the linux file being incomplete or empty. I then restored from prior backup, and tried updating again. Which led to the same error in grub. I have looked around, and haven’t been able to find any solutions. Any ideas?

                              <span>Steam Deck User here. I cant use the makepkg -S command -&gt; doesnt find fake root binary. Guides tell me to install base-devel. But when im trying that im getting „untrusted“ issues like that: 
 error: m4: signature from &quot;Antonio Rojas arojas@archlinux.org&quot; is unknown trust :: File /var/cache/pacman/pkg/m4-1.4.19-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst is corrupted (invalid or corrupted package (PGP signature)).
 This is only one example, it outputs mulitple of those. I tried to reset the key database and multiple commands i found online but it still doesnt work. Hope someone can help me out :)

                              <span>So, the package lib32-openjpeg2 on AUR got recently updated to version 2.5.0, but the current one on my system (2.4.0) has a dependency on openjpeg2&#x3D;2.4.0. So I cannot update with pacman, because then my openjpeg2 would get updated to 2.5.0, which breaks the lib32-openjpeg2 dependency on it being only 2.4.0, and I cannot update lib32-openjpeg2 from AUR (using yay) because it wants to update openjpeg2 from repos before and it fails the same.
 So, what&#x27;s the way out of this?
  
EDIT: Solved using the --nodeps (-Sd) option.

I want to replace it with my own file but anything I do doesn&#x27;t work. If I try to remove the symlink or replace it with my own file it says Device or resource busy. How can I do it from inside the chroot? My setup scripts run in chroot so I&#x27;d like to solve it there.

                              <span>Novice Arch user here, I&#x27;m installing a lot of aur packages and in most cases they are very downloaded by everyone.
 If I understood right how the AUR works, a dangerous package is one that is not very downloaded and ... that&#x27;s about it. I think/hope there is moderation done on the AUR packages so the major part of dangerous packages are deleted very early.
 So correct me if I&#x27;m wrong but there very few packages out there that are really dangerous for my system ?
 + Another question : How is moderation on the AUR atm ? (sorry for my english btw)

                              <span>Hi,
 A few days ago, I had a weird Bluetooth headset crash, audio stopped and the headset acted like it was connected and turned off at the same time. As I already had this kind of situations, I disabled Bluetooth, turned it back on and reconnected the headset. But this time, upon reconnecting, I had no sound coming out from it.
 The only sound I am able to hear are the notification sounds from GNOME. That&#x27;s it.
 I tested a BT speaker, a wired headset and even the internal speakers wouldn&#x27;t work at all, which is very annoying because I use this laptop mostly for entertainment.
 I started running some tests : 
 The laptop speakers do work properly. I tested under Windows 10 (the laptop dual boots) and the speakers and BT speakers do work properly.
 I tried to make it forget the headset that had the crash and pairing it back to no avail.
 speaker-test (from alsa-utils) didn&#x27;t work so I guess there&#x27;s the issue ?
 EasyEffects seem to detect audio from apps (I tested with Firefox, Audacious and VLC) but no sound waves are displayed, indicating that the issue must be before PipeWire in the audio software stack. In the case of Audacious, it&#x27;s internal sound wave display works, indicating that audio is being decoded by the app.
 No, the sound was not muted and the correct output was chosen in the settings. That&#x27;s the first things I&#x27;ve checked.
 I&#x27;m pretty sure the issue lies within ALSA but how can it be persistent after reboot if it was a crash ? Is there a way to put it back to default settings ?
 I&#x27;m running pretty much the same audio software stack on my main desktop and I regularly use BT speakers with it and I hadn&#x27;t encountered this issue (it runs on KDE but that shouldn&#x27;t affect audio as far as I&#x27;m aware of).

 Console (vt) size on UHD is 1/4 of the monitor. While on FullHD shows console on a whole surface. Resolution (dpi) is proper, btw.
 If FullHD is disconnected and UHD monitor is the only one connected, it shows console on a full surface as well.

                              <span>I have been having an issue where pacman is installing to my root partition that is only 30GB so installing things like the cudnn package is filling up my entire drive along with other things that I have only just realized are doing that. I have been looking for a way to make it so that pacman installs in my main LVM partition, but have found that nothing on the wiki that says I can even do that. So with this in mind, my question is this: Is there a way to change where pacman installs so that it&#x27;s not in my root partition or will I have to reinstall and give my root partition more space keeping in mind the packages I want to install?
 ​
 I have done my best to RTFM for pacman and the closest thing I have found is a reddit post suggesting it would be possible to change the pacman package installation directory. This would be to create a hook which I am assuming means if it hits this directory redirect it to another one. Though I don&#x27;t know enough to know if this is good solution or something that would bite me later.
