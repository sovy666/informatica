                              <span>I have a ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9 with an encrypted LUKS2 root partition with FIDO2 authentication. It is a dual boot setup with Windows 11, where systemd will chainload an EFIstub.
 I want to protect against Evil Maid attacks and want to sign systemd-boot and my EFIstub with keys that will then be enrolled in Secure Boot.
 The best way to do this seems to be to use /u/Foxboron&#x27;s sbctl utility, but I&#x27;m worried about doing so because ThinkPad X1 Carbon models have had a propensity to brick when secure boot keys have been enrolled improperly: https://old.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/epadb5/psa_dont_install_custom_secure_boot_keys_on_x1/
 I&#x27;m not sure if the issue has been fixed between Gen7 and Gen9, but my Gen9 does require OpRom in the boot chain. I&#x27;m not sure what the right steps to take to properly enroll self signing in UEFI with such hardware is.
 Could anyone confirm they&#x27;ve successfully done this process on an X1 Carbon Gen 9 using sbctl and that has not resulted in a brick of the laptop? If so, could you point me to some steps on how to do that?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>What are the best practices for partially upgrading packages? I know that this is not recommended, but it is not clear to me why it is not and it would be extremely convenient to be able to selectively choose which packages to upgrade.
 ​
 This came to attention when I recently tried to install imagemagick. 
 I get an error - imagemagick-7.1.0.28-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst failed to download
 I imagine that I need to upgrade my mirrors or synchronize my package database, but either way having to do &#x60;pacman -Syu would upgrade all my packages. What should I be doing instead?

I noticed that a few other people have had this issue these past few days on this subreddit, but even after trying all of the fixes people reccomended in those threads I&#x27;m unable to fix the issue.
 So far I&#x27;ve tried deleting all files in /var/lib/pacman/sync, clearing the cache completely with &#x27;paccache -rk 0&#x27;, running &#x27;pacman -Syy&#x27; then &#x27;pacman -S archlinux-keyring&#x27;, to no avail.
 Any ideas on what more I could do to fix this issue? Thanks.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m not able to boot into KDE, I can only move between TTY2-6 with CTRL+ALT+F*. 
 I have both the default and hardened kernels installed, the issue is the same on both, but on the hardened session I have an error message reading
 &quot;libbpf: failed to find valid kernel BTF libbpf: Error loading vmlinux BTF: -3 libbpf: failed to load object &#x27;iterators_bpf&#x27; libbpf: failed to load BPF skeleton &#x27;iterators_bpf&#x27;: -3 Failed load could be due to wrong endianness&quot;
 I have tried searching for fixes related to this message, unable to find anything relevant to what I&#x27;m experiencing.
 This issue started after I installed steam, so I had run a partial upgrade by accident to add the multilib packages, then ran a full upgrade. Here I decided to shut the system down to install two other SSD&#x27;s I used for storing games on my old rig. 
 Powered everything up, grub was fine, and the error I mentioned earlier shows up during the journal recovery screen before KDE loads.
 So far, with my TTY, I have tried reinstalling KDE and trying various methods of getting a gui session, like Ctrl+Alt+F7, and systemctl commands to start/restart kde&#x27;s services.
 I have tried the loginctl command, which only returns my current TTY session, or any others that happen to be open.
 I should mention that I used the archinstall script during installation, but I can&#x27;t imagine that would affect anything. If there&#x27;s anything else I should provide I&#x27;ll do my best to add it.
 I am somewhat new to troubleshooting Arch, so I&#x27;m certain there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m overlooking. Any help or ideas is much appreciated, thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve just tried to setup JACK so I can do some quality audio recording on my system, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything and I can&#x27;t figure out why. I have both my input and output devices set up in ALSA with seemingly no issue (have tested with arecord and aplay), and I have JACK and qjackctl installed. JACK seems to be set up to use ALSA as the driver and everything is set to default, but none of the DAWs I&#x27;ve tried seem to be able to record any audio when I have them set up to connect to JACK (I&#x27;ve tried both Ardour and Reaper).
 My speakers are connected through a Schiit Modi 2 and my microphone is through a Zoom H4n, if that information helps.
 Happy to provide any other information, and thanks in advance for any help you can offer!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got community/discord 0.0.17-1 installed and running sway version 1.7. I&#x27;m just running discord via /usr/bin/discord which I believe uses XWayland (since it&#x27;s using the bundled electron rather than system electron and swaymsg -t get_tree shows a null app_id). Whenever I receive a new discord message, I see the appropriate mako notification. However, when I click on the notification, discord crashes with the following:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; ../../third_party/tcmalloc/chromium/src/free_list.cc:135] Memory corruption detected.
 Failed to get crash dump id. Report Id: 39eabcfe-e434-40 zsh: segmentation fault (core dumped) discord &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Everything is up to date on my system, so not sure what&#x27;s causing this. It&#x27;s the only app that I&#x27;ve experienced this so far.
 A bit more info about the system:
  
extra/wayland 1.20.0-2
 extra/xorg-xwayland 22.1.1-1 (xorg)
 community/sway 1:1.7-2
 community/mako 1.6-3
 community/wlroots 0.15.1-3
 Linux LTS: 5.15.36-1
 Intel i7-8650U CPU @ 1.90GHz
 Intel Corporation UHD Graphics 620
 16GB Ram
  
Any thoughts about what could be causing this and how to go about fixing it? The arch wiki troubleshooting section doesn&#x27;t mention anything about this specific issue, so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m asking here.

                              <span>Hi!
 I have been trying to understand why the binaries of duckstation-git are not working as intended, given that when I manually build it using the instructions on the project&#x27;s Git Hub, it worked flawlessly.
 i came to realize that it was due to the &quot;-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE&#x3D;Release&quot; flag. But as the CMake package guidelines on the Wiki says, it produces undesired behavior on PKGBUILDs, as it uses the -O3 compiler optimization flag, while the default default Arch Linux flag which currently is -O2.
 Building the PKGBUILD with &quot;-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE&#x3D;None&quot; as the Wiki suggests makes the binaries doesn&#x27;t work at all.
 Does anyone know if there is any cmake flag or build option to make it work?

                              <span>The answer is YES and you know why? because SDL 1.2 development ended long ago, with SDL 2.0 replacing it. However, many older games still use SDL 1.2 and cannot change to SDL 2.0. In order to help move SDL 1.2 games into the modern world, so SDL 1.2 is replaced with sdl12-compat, which uses SDL 2.0.

                              <span>Hi all, I’ve been setting up my compositor picom-jonaburg. I have noticed this weird visual issue. It’s as though it’s in limbo between both lines and wants to represent them both. Here’s an example: https://imgur.com/a/cxTLwj0
 As of now, it’s only present in urxvt/vim. It doesn’t occur at the start of the file. It’s also not occurring symmetrically. In an 89 line file, it only starts at line 47 consistently. If I put my cursor on line 46 it stops, back to 47 it continues. This pattern of movement doesn’t stop it from happening from lines 47 to the bottom.
 Any ideas of where to start looking? Picom? Xresources ?

I haven&#x27;t changed any settings or anything and in nvtop it shows nothing while in game. it used to show the exetuables running in nvtop.

 Any ideas on what the issue might be?

                              <span>Is it safe to check arch repo and aur updates using paru -Qua instead of checkupdates+aur which is broken (not work with aur anymore) ?

                              <span>Hey y&#x27;all, 
 I&#x27;m looking for a program that automatically syncs files and folders from one drive to another. I am dual-booting Windows (don&#x27;t judge me need it for work) so I have some games and programs that are installed on both Arch and Windows and files I wish to have on both systems (e.g. save files, mods, pictures et cetera). 
 What would be your choice of software for that? 
 Thanks in advance!

 lvs, blkid, lsblk do not show any of them.
 But when I execute lvcreate -L 25G -n debian vg0 the system is asking: WARNING: ext4 signature detected on /dev/vg0/debian at offset 1080. Wipe it? [y/n]:
 Of course, if only I remember all of the lvm partitions I had removed during the year it was not a problem to lvcreate them, wipefs the devices, and lvremove again.

                              <span>Hi everyone. I&#x27;ve recently hopped over to arch (gnome), and I&#x27;ve been having problems with my CPU temperatures. Before this, I was using Manjaro, and everything worked fine. Now, when idling the cpu sits at 50-60*C and when doing heavy tasks it gets up to 100*C. My fans are fine, this is a recently purchased Acer Swift 3, so what I&#x27;m guessing is the problem is that the OS isn&#x27;t communicating with some hardware. I&#x27;ve ran sensors-detect, and tried controlling my fan speed that way, but it comes back with &quot;There are no pwm capable fans in your system&#x27;, which may be the problem. (Side note: After installing arch and installing some packages, my maximum RAM went down from ~16.4 to 15.2, the same as I had on Manjaro, even though when I play some games with memory leaks the ram usage will rise above that number. Probably unrelated, but thought I should share.) Anyways, if you need more info let me know, all help appreciated!

                              <span>It almost seems like the Xorg session is related or something? This system just started doing this consistently yesterday but its done it in the past with an older install of arch but it was rare and reboot resolved it so I never figured out the why.
 basically the audio wont work at all for anything in anyway and video playback in web-browser, specifically youtube and twitch wont really play. I can scrub a youtube video and video play back window will update with an image of whats in the video at that point I stopped in the time line but it wont play said video. Twitch will update one frame every like 30 seconds but thats it. this issue is persistent in both firefox and google chrome. I can play an mkv or local video via VLC just fine (though still no audio). Audio is set to the right output, wont work if I send it to the onboard audio out or bluetooth.
 if i log out of my DE (KDE plasma xorg) and sign into (KDE) wayland, it all works fine, audio plays, video will render and play. I&#x27;d love to just ditch xorg and go to wayland but wayland seems to have its own issues, primarily games wont render a framerate higher than my displays refresh rate and I&#x27;ve not been able to find any info on solving that issue so I&#x27;ve been sticking to Xorg but this issue is worse so im at a bit of a loss on how to fix it.
 this happened yesterday, a reboot didnt solve the issue. I nuked the nvidia drivers, rebooted, reinstalled the nvidia drivers and that seemed to have fixed it so I thought that was that but the issue has returned today and im not quite sure where the junction is cuz I thought video rendering and audio issues were normally entirely separate so idk whats up.
 any one have any idea or point me in a useful direction?

                              <span>Google Maps is popular and robust enough to have more or less brought on the death of the paper map, and with features like a speed limit checker it feels like it’s getting more and more accessible by the day. But there are still reasons why you wouldn’t want to, or can’t, use Google Maps. Some countries, like China, run a pretty tight ship when it comes to regulation, making Google Maps as good as useless. 
    
Or maybe you just don’t want Google algorithms profiting off your data. Whatever your reasons, we won’t pry and instead treat you to the best Google maps alternatives that work similarly well as Google Maps.

                              <span>AutoHotkey is one of the best Windows automation programs that can perform the simplest of actions to the hardest of tasks. AutoHotkey is a free and open-source program which uses its own scripting language to automate any of your daily Windows tasks. Even though the “scripting language” sounds intimidating, it is very easy to use, and you can do all sorts of cool things.
    
Let me share my favorite and most-used AutoHotkey scripts, which make daily tasks a little bit easier, and that may help you too.
    
Before starting, it’s assumed you already know how to install and configure AutoHotkey. Moreover, please note that the lines starting with ; are comments.

I can see that there is a feed to get the latest but am struggling to find the software to make this work (RSS on the wiki give very little). 
 Can someone suggest a suitable torrent package or package combo to retrieve the rss, download the torrent and seed it?

                              <span>I was playing around with my system today trying to compile and fix some things, and one of these things required me to patch the Linux kernel. I used the ABS method, patched, and compiled with makepkg -s. The patch didn&#x27;t fix my issue so it&#x27;s irrelevant to the post, but it was the reason for building the kernel in the first place. 
 Before I compiled it, for another thing I was messing around, I had also changed makepkg.conf to include march&#x3D;native and to use all my CPU cores. For some reason, after booting my custom kernel (which should be the same as the one Arch Linux provides), it feels more responsive, but I have no easy way to verify it, other than going back to the arch kernel and running similar benchmarks
 My question is, is there performance or other benefits in building your own kernel ? and is there an easy way to compare the responsiveness of the kernels?

                              <span>Essentially, going from windows to arch and I&#x27;ve been at this for over 8 hours trying to figure out why grub never loads. I just get booted constantly into the install or BIOS but never the long awaited gnu grub loader.
 I forgot to add that I don&#x27;t have any way to enter an OS since I was planning on doing a clean swap.

 I downloaded the tarball from SourceForge linked here.
 I did the chmod a+x ./setup.py, and then ./setup.py install, but it gives error:

                              <span>It’s safe to assume that at this point most tech-savvy Windows users have made the switch from SATA hard drives to SSDs – whether by getting a relatively new PC or by doing the upgrade themselves.
    
Windows has plenty of features that help SSDs operate to their full potential, but it doesn’t always enable them by default. In addition, many of the “must-do” rules from the early days of SSDs aren’t necessarily valid anymore, and we’re going to dispel those here. (You may be particularly surprised to hear that defragging isn’t such a bad idea!)
    
Read on for the latest list of dos and don’ts for your SSD.
