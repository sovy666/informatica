                              <span>Hello everyone! I&#x27;m trying to set up my Arch installation so that pressing the PrtScr key will open an interactive screenshot prompt to allow me to select a portion of the screen. I&#x27;m using the Budgie desktop environment with gnome-screenshot.
 On the surface, this sounds easy—according to the keyboard shortcuts, I just press the PrtScr key (image)!
 But pressing the PrtScr key takes a full-screen screenshot (with a white border flash and saving to Pictures). And disabling that shortcut doesn&#x27;t change anything—it still takes a full-screen screenshot and saves it to Pictures. 
 If I uninstall gnome-screenshot, it stops taking screenshots when I press PrtScr. But when I assign the PrtScr button to any other shortcuts (for example, to launch Flameshot, another screenshot utility), nothing happens when I press it.
 So my problem is that: 
  
When gnome-screenshot is installed, I can only use PrtScr to take a full-screen screenshot.
 When gnome-screenshot is uninstalled, I can&#x27;t use PrtScr for any other shortcuts.
  
Does anybody know what&#x27;s going on here?

                              <span>There are various reasons why your Android or iOS device won’t read the SIM card. Some possible causes could be that you didn’t insert the SIM card correctly or your device is experiencing a software issue. Whatever the reason, a solution needs to be found quickly when your phone says: “No SIM card detected.”
    
Here are some fixes for those times when your phone can’t detect the SIM card. 
    
Note: Depending on the brand and model of your phone, some of the settings may not be available in the same locations as discussed below. For example, for certain settings, you may have to navigate to “Network &amp; Internet -&gt; Mobile Networks” instead of “SIM cards &amp; Mobile Networks” on some phones.

                              <span>Hi All,
 I&#x27;ve been having a very weird issue with my system for a while. Whenever my laptop&#x27;s been in sleep mode (lid closed) for a while (it seems to be only when it&#x27;s been closed for a few hours), I&#x27;ll open it up only to be presented with the luks prompt, meaning that it&#x27;s rebooted itself while in sleep mode.
 I used to not have any swap, but I recently set up a swap file (12G for my 8G RAM) for hibernation. I&#x27;ve confirmed that hibernation works flawlessly, but for some reason, this issue persists. The output from journalctl doesn&#x27;t seem to provide any useful info, I&#x27;ll paste it here.

Not only the software like Blender and OBS can&#x27;t seem to find the CUDA device, but it&#x27;s also a system-wide thing (seen in deviceQuery logs). Installing CUDA manually on Void didn&#x27;t help either. Alas, running Arch on my second HDD and installing CUDA through pacman also did nothing. It&#x27;s driving me nuts because when I tried using Blender on the same machine with Windows 10 it worked like a charm and I&#x27;m not planning to switch back any time soon. Searching online gave me pretty bad results, either the forum posts were dead and inactive or people managed to fix it by rebooting their PC (which is amusing as I&#x27;ve had this issue for about a year n…</span>

                              <span>Greetings fellow Arch users.
 I&#x27;v been on Arch for about 4 months. It worked flawlessly until today when i decided to switch the UI language to German. I have the Cinnamon DE and the original install was made in English, but the keyboard was set to German since day 1. 
 As i couldn&#x27;t find the language settings in Cinnamon, I followed this guide : 
 https://arcolinux.com/how-to-change-the-language-of-your-desktop-on-arcolinux-or-arch-linux-any-desktop/
 After reboot, i could not launch the terminal anymore but the GUI worked and it was in German.
 I began freaking out and went frantically to revert the changes i made using a GUI. I was succesful in reverting both the locale.gen and locale.conf using a text editor and a hex editor, respectivelly.
 After reboot the UI reverted back to English but i still cannot launch the terminal. And my system is now pretty useless. I cannot live without the terminal lol.

 I am trying to finish the installation but obviously I do not have the proper drivers for my machine. I am using NX8600GT card and all I can run is the command prompt. Any ideas about how should I proceed please? Pretty much everything is set up - the system is installed, the accounts are set, the system is upgraded, I have installed the fonts and SDDM + KDE Plasma but no luck so far! The wiki articles are big help but some of them are just too advanced since I am a newbie and this is my first Arch installation. 
 Thanks in advance for all the help!

                              <span>I have this weird issue lately where anything that uses chromium engine (Brave, Electron apps, Steam, etc.) just randomly freezes when I&#x27;m doing something like clicking on a link, typing on a text box, or loading a video. It won&#x27;t response to my clicks or my keyboard input. It happens for few second before the program becomes responsive again. 
 The frequency is unpredictable. Sometimes Brave never freeze on one session, sometimes it freezes many times under an hour of use.
 Has this happened to anyone? I have Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 with Ryzen 5 4600U (no discrete GPU) and running on LTS kernel 5.15 and xorg server (dwm).
 Edit: Intellij IDEA is not an electron app and I may misremember it being frozen along with Brave.

 I updated today the Linux kernel, unfortunately I can&#x27;t start x11 anymore. Current kernel: 5.18.1-arch1-1 updated from: 5.18-arch1-1
 Xorg.0.log:
 NVIDIA(0): The NVIDIA X Driver has encountered an error; attempting to NVIDIA(0): recover... NVIDIA(GPU-0): Failed to allocate notification memory. NVIDIA(0): Failed to allocate push buffer NVIDIA(0): Error recovery failed. NVIDIA(0): *** Aborting ** 
 I was using nvidia but also tested nvidia-dkms. nvidia-dkms: 515.43.04-2 nvidia: 515.43.04
 Didn&#x27;t found anything error related to nvidia in dmesg.
 I&#x27;m also tried to downgrade the kernel and nvidia driver but I got the same error.
 Tried to search the problem but I didn&#x27;t found something about it. Maybe someone knows anything about it.
 ​
 EDIT: found the problem. nitrogen for wallpaper is the issue. idk yet why but if i&#x27;m using it the driver cant load.

                              <span>Hello
 I have a Lenovo Ideapad 3 laptop with Arch installed. It has an efi fat32 partition, a swap partition, and a large unencrypted ext4 root partition occupying all of the remaining space. Arch was installed on it in manual mode without encryption. Tried to encrypt its root partition with LUKS post install. To do that, I booted with the live USB, following the archwiki instructions in https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dm-crypt. The exact sequence of actions was as follows:
 ​
 Resized the partition
 e2fsck -f /dev/nvme0n1p3
 resize2fs -p -M /dev/nvme0n1p3
 cryptsetup reencrypt --encrypt --reduce-device-size 32M /dev/nvme0n1p3
 cryptsetup open /dev/nvme0n1p3 recrypt
 resize2fs /dev/mapper/recrypt
 mounted the partitions and chrooted to /mnt
 mount /dev/mapper/recrypt /mnt
 mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot/efi
 arch-chroot /mnt
 Edited mkinitcpio.conf to add the encrypt hook, and /etc/default/grub to add the lines
 GRUB_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK&#x3D;y
 GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX&#x3D;&quot;cryptdevice&#x3D;UUID&#x3D;123456:root root&#x3D;/dev/mapper/root&quot;
 I changed the relative path to UUID for root&#x3D; later.
 Generated kernel image and grub with
 mkinitcpio -P
 grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
 Those ran without errors.
 ​
 After rebooting I am dropped into the rescue GRUB shell with the message &quot;unknown filesystem&quot;. Tried doing the operation on a virtual machine prior to this, successfully. OS on the VM was installed with the archinstall script though.
 Root partition can be decrypted when booting with the live USB with &quot;cryptsetup open&quot;.
 ​
 Some extra info that can be useful image gallery . lsblk and blkid command output, mkinitcpio.conf and /etc/default/grub files.

                              <span>In recent update of Arch Linux, In GNOME/KDE (gdm/sddm), after I lock the screen for a long time, the screen display a bright border ghosting like this:
 https://photos.app.goo.gl/mctXen7U8XWvKtA59
 But only if some program opened as Chrome, Firefox, PyCharm,... When I lock screen with some other program opened like Visual Studio Code the problem isn&#x27;t appear.
 I tried switch to Windows 11 (clean install, up to date) and have no problem like above. So I don&#x27;t think It&#x27;s a hardware problem.
 My Arch Linux is up to date too.
 Does anyone know what happened or have any idea?

 Backstory :
 Last week i decided to install Arch Linux for fun and dual boot between Arch and Windows.
 After configuring my system to what I thought was efficient and cool for me, I started to continue my regular day to day stuff and my project dev on this newly installed and configured setup.
 At the time, I was storing all my important work and dev files on a single VHDX to be comfortable when backing up (which i never did). Because the type of data I stored on that virtual disk consisted of very tiny files (for example node_modules, source files, etc.) which are a pain in transferring them to other places.
 Because of that, I needed to ac…</span>

I tried the playonlinux guide right here: https://www.addictivetips.com/ubuntu-linux-tips/install-adobe-creative-cloud-apps-on-linux/
 But it did not work for me because after installing the adobe cc &#x27;launcher&#x27;, it said it could not access network or that time date and time was wrong. I hit a brick wall and was wondering if any of you found a different guide to install adobe apps. Or if you made the guide that I tried work. I also tried the install script that exists on lutris but did not install for me. I dont care about which version of the adobe apps have, they are all the same anyways. Any help is highly appreciated.

                              <span>I was considering getting a new GPU with the recent decrease in GPU prices and I was curious as to whether people had experience regarding Wayland recently. I had heard that NVIDIA improved their driver support regarding the newer cards but I&#x27;ve also generally heard more positive things regarding AMD&#x27;s GPU support especially over the long run. Last time I had gave Wayland a shot (gtx 960 w/ both proprietary and nouvaeu) my 144hz flickered black about half the time if left at the full refresh rate so I ended up going back to X11.

                              <span>[Solved! Answer was &quot;all of them&quot;. For any future folks, you&#x27;re not going to brick anything.]
 Hi all!
 I&#x27;m trying to install Arch on a Chromebook, using the install guide.
 So far I have installed SeaBIOS via Mr Chromebox script. Not sure whether I&#x27;ve overwritten Chrome OS / its loader, but I feel like I may have.
 At the point I am now, the guide says I should be partitioning my disk. However, my disk already has partitions- twelve of them, in fact. Looking stuff up to see whether I can delete them has confused me. I hear that I might remove a bootloader, or I might accidentally brick my computer.
 Here is what comes from running fdisk -l (apologies that I can&#x27;t screenshot and then upload, for obvious reasons :B)
 Any advice on the next step to take would be appreciated. I am 100% fine and in fact wanting to remove Chrome OS itself from the computer. All I know is that I cannot proceed without doing something, as I cannot &quot;install essential packages&quot; due to lack of space in my partition.
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Hi,
 I am using a 2018 legion y740 laptop and trying to boot arch linux for the first time off an external ssd, but everytime after archinstall when I try to boot, these same lines would pop up and freeze the system. I can&#x27;t type or do anything.
 I have searched online about this issue and they said to blacklist the driver, which doesn&#x27;t sound very safe.

Back then it was difficult getting peripherals working under Linux from 56k modems to printers and other components today where Linux support can just be assumed. Open-source graphics drivers back then were also in their infancy and lacking vendor support while NVIDIA was well regarded then for their proprietary driver being at least featureful and performant. It&#x27;s been quite a journey...</span>

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;m having a rough day with Arch, and would appreciate quick replies if you know how to fix this.
 To explain previous events, my previously working install spontaneously decided not to boot today. This is the error message I get:
 error: no such partition
 error: you need to load the kernel first.
 error: you need to load the kernel first.
 I chrooted with my Arch usb and found out that I was completely running out of space in my EFI partition, and so (I&#x27;m assuming) that an update failed and I didn&#x27;t have what I needed to actually boot. Again, I have no idea if that&#x27;s the issue, but I do know there were error messages saying there wasn&#x27;t enough space so I managed to clear some up.
 I figured I should reinstall the kernel to be safe, since it still wasn&#x27;t booting at this point, and now I&#x27;m getting this error message:
 Error: GDBUS.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown: The name org.freedesktop.PackageKit was not provided by any .service files
 Error: command failed to execute correctly
 How do I go about fixing this? Is there anything else I should be looking for that I&#x27;m missing? Thank you so much I&#x27;m kinda really desperate so if you help me I&#x27;ll worship you as a new modern god.

                              <span>Since the last kernel (5.18) im having issue to put my system into &quot;suspend&quot; status. With grub-bootloader the system wont goes to suspend, simply crash, nothing into journalctl, zero errors related to the suspend. 
 Just formated my drive, re-installed arch but with systemd-bootloader. The system goes to sleep but when return, carshed again. The log below is just before and after the crash. Tried with another kernels &lt; 5.18 and everything went normal. 
 My specs are: R5 5600g, x570 chipset, 3060, 32 ram. 
 Im tried using both nvidia drivers (proprietary and open (dkms either when tried with zen)) to see if it was a driver problem but no success...

I recently installed on my laptop as well and have been configuring it. I&#x27;m to a point where everything works perfectly besides a highly aggravating issue:
 After I close the laptop without shutting down the OS, it goes to sleep as normal.
 When I open it, it comes back to life normally. However, from then until a reboot, the screen (and keyboard, and entire OS) go to sleep randomly every 20-30 seconds regardless of user input on the machine. It takes about 5 seconds for it to wake back up on input and repeats.
 The laptop is a 2018 Razer Blade Stealth, which I&#x27;m aware is not known to be particularly Linux-friendly. Not really sure where to start with th…</span>

 Not exactly sure what&#x27;s triggering it, what could it be? Maybe it started happening after an update? I&#x27;m honestly not so sure

 Python 3.10 works as usual. I tried a clean installation of python and pip itself from pacman but with any result. LMK if you have any suggestion for this problem. Thanks in advance.
 P. S. I will surely use AUR packages in the future.

                              <span>Hi, I have a dual boot MSI with Arch Linux and Windows 11, since a few days back the sound in Arch Linux is not working properly. After I start the laptop I get no audio, I need to go to pulseaudio settings and change the Tiger Lake-H HD Audio Controller profile from &quot;Play HiFi quality Music&quot; (the default option) to &quot;Off&quot; and then back to &quot;Play HiFi quality Music&quot; in order to get my sound back. Even doing this, if I pause something and then play it back the sound is gone again. Do any of you know why is this happening?
 Thank all in advance.
 Edit: Solved it installing pipewire-pulse and uninstalling pulseaudio.

                              <span>hey, I’m using Arch with Cinnamon DE. I have changed my preferred application for terminal as ‘konsole’. But whenever I try to open vim, R or Julia from my start panel. The application would open it in gnome terminal instead of opening it in konsole. How do i change that to konsole?? 
 Also, ctrl+shift+T opens konsole. It’s just the applications.

                              <span>Android devices don’t always allow you to open every file type you download or receive in your email. The same applies to compressing a file or group of files. Depending on what the file is, this may be a big inconvenience. Some file managers let you compress or decompress zip files, but what happens if there is a rar or 7z file you need to open? ZArchiver lets you compress and extract files on Android, even if your file manager won’t.

                              <span>For better or worse, WhatsApp is the foremost messaging platform on Android (as much though as I champion Signal at every possible opportunity). With the “Status” feature, it doubles as a kind of mini social-network platform, letting users post a status that expires after a certain amount of time (although you can also make it permanent).
    
These statuses can sometimes be funny clips or memes, and if you want to get your hands on them, there’s a way to do it without asking your friends. Here’s how.

                              <span>L&#x27;installazione di ogni feature update per Windows 10 sottrae temporaneamente un certo quantitativo di spazio aggiuntivo sull&#x27;hard disk o sull&#x27;unità SSD dove il sistema operativo è installato.Si tratta di un approccio col quale si vogliono mettere gli utenti nelle condizioni di disinstallare l&#x27;aggiornamento nel caso in cui qualcosa non dovesse andare per il verso giusto.Da quando è stata rilasciata la versione finale di Windows 11 i pacchetti di aggiornamento più corposi (feature update, appunto) vengono pubblicati a cadenza annuale tra ottobre e novembre.È in particolare la cartella Windows.old che contiene i file necessari per avviare eventualmente il ripristino di Windows 10 recuperando la versione del sistema operativo installata in precedenza: basta scrivere Reimposta il PC nella casella di ricerca del pulsante Start e cliccare su Inizia in corrispondenza di Torna alla versione precedente di Windows 10.Installando Windows 10 21H2 su una delle precedenti versioni di Windows 10 o addirittura aggiornando Windows 7 o Windows 8.1 sarà possibile riportare il sistema alla precedente configurazione in caso di problemi.

Il contenuto della cartella Windows.old viene automaticamente rimosso trascorsi 10 giorni dall&#x27;effettuazione dell&#x27;aggiornamento.In un altro articolo abbiamo visto come aumentare il numero di giorni per tornare alla versione precedente di Windows 10 qualora, a scopo cautelativo, si volesse tenere per sé qualche giorno in più per assicurarsi che l&#x27;aggiornamento applicato non crei alcun problema.

Nell&#x27;esempio in figura, la cartella &#x27;di backup&#x27; Windows.old pesa circa 22 GB ma le sue dimensioni possono variare notevolmente a seconda della versione di Windows di partenza e quella di Windows 10 che viene installata.</span>
