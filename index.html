                              <span>I&#x27;ve been a Debian user for a long time, and just tried arch for the first time. I&#x27;m still happy with Debian but I got gifted an old laptop and wanted to try something different on it. Also I had trouble getting android studio and flutter to work on Debian (although others seem to have no problem) and I thought it would be nice to have a Linux system that could run newer programs and systems without issue. 
 I&#x27;ve been loyal to Debian because I love the stability, being able to sit down to a system that just always works and not having to do too much maintenance. Which is probably not good for switching Arch, but I figured why not, since so many seem to enjoy it. Some people say Arch breaks and needs maintenance, others say it&#x27;s very stable and they only update it once every few weeks. I&#x27;m …</span>

                              <span>Just installed arch, and now my main partition is apparently full, sans 400mb. This makes no goddamn sense.The closest thing ive got is that when I was partitioning this SSD, the logs for the size of what was going to be swap (didnt keep the swap) stayed when I made /dev/sda2 the root partition (which gnome disks lists as its actual size). Can&#x27;t install or do shit with the system reading stuff like this.Any ideas on how to fix this? 
 SOLVED: Ran [ resize2fs -f /dev/sda2 ] as root, it resized the ext4 filesystem on sda2 to fill the partition.

                              <span>I recently updated my system after a few weeks of not updating and rebooted. I get this message when I enter the decryption key into tinyssh.
  ~ &gt; ssh root@10.0.10.3 Enter passphrase for /dev/sda1: cryptsetup(209): Function not implemented cryptsetup: no process found Connection to 10.0.10.3 closed. 
 I can still ping the server, but then I end up not being able to SSH into the system and it seemingly hangs endlessly.
 Whereas usually I encounter on a successful bootup:
  ~ &gt; ssh root@10.0.10.3 Enter passphrase for /dev/sda1: Connection to 10.0.10.3 closed. 
 I can still manually decrypt the LUKS container, mount the LVM volume, and interact with files if I boot into a microSD card instead of trying a remote unlock. I&#x27;m using the LVM on LUKS setup described on the Arch Wiki. fsck reports clean drives as well. What could be going on?

According to the kernel documentation, for /proc/i8k to exist, the kernel must be compiled with the CONFIG_I8K. And, here&#x27;s the diff for the 5.18 kernel. CONFIG_IK8 has gone. Why? Is there a fix? Is i8kutils just dead?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to get a Gentoo system up, and running; but, have been running into issues getting it to boot properly. Previously, I installed Raspbian on the Pi, created a partition for Gentoo, and tried to build and bootstrap from there. For some reason the kernel is not able to load the Gentoo root partition.
 So, I think it would be faster and easier to just build a kernel from my Arch machine for the Pi. My Gentoo machine won&#x27;t be up for a couple of weeks, and I&#x27;d like to get this working sooner. So, how can I compile the Raspberry Pi kernel from Arch? How should I go about configuring QEMU?

 i reverted back to linux-5.17.7 and rtl8821ce is working fine. Just wondering if anyone else bumped into the same issue.

                              <span>OK, so I&#x27;ve just created a gaming meta-package. One of its dependencies is lib32-pipewire-jack, because my system will use Pipewire. However, when I try and install it Pacman still asks me:
 :: There are 2 providers available for lib32-jack: :: Repository multilib 1) lib32-jack2 2) lib32-pipewire-jack Enter a number (default&#x3D;1): 
 It&#x27;s a problem, because one can easily hit enter by accident and install lib32-jack2 instead. (Well actually you can&#x27;t because Pacman throws an error saying lib32-jack2 and lib32-pipewire-jack are in conflict). How can I force my package to install lib32-pipewire-jack instead of asking for a lib32-jack provider?

 https://github.com/thesofproject/linux/issues/3393
 My various attempts at compiling have failed for fewer and fewer reasons that I can grasp, and I don&#x27;t know arch at all.
 But this arch .config: https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/config?h&#x3D;linux-p3-patch
 apparently works. Can I use that .config in xubuntu?
 Many thanks for any help, Jake

                              <span>For the past couple days, I&#x27;ve been trying to install Arch in a VM (Virt-Manager) with Systemd-boot as the bootloader with no success.
 I&#x27;ve successfully installed with GRUB as the bootloader but I wanted to try my hand with Systemd-boot since it comes with systemd. So I know the general steps to install Arch. That&#x27;s not the problem. My problem is the bootloader part. Despite taking the steps outlined n the wiki (mount esp to /boot --&gt; run bootctl install --&gt; create loader.conf, arch.conf, and arch-fallback.conf --&gt; exit chroot --&gt; reboot), I always end up back at the EFI shell. 
 Am I missing a step or something? I&#x27;ve ensured that /dev/vda1 is an EFI partition, formatted to Fat32, mounted to /boot, ran bootctl sucessfully with no errors, created the necessary files. I&#x27;ve confirmed that initramfs-linux, initramfs-linux-fallback, and vmlinuz-linux files are where they need to be (/boot). When I reboot I get to a screen where the only option is &quot;Return to firmware interface.&quot; 
 What I am doing wrong? Help me, Arch Gods!!!!
 UPDATE : HOLY CRAP I GOT IT!!!!

                              <span>When playing Minecraft there is a problem with changing the keyboard language. When I change the layout the screen starts blinking, and then you get to the desktop, but I can not do anything there, everything lags, and the extensions behave strangely. This can only be fixed with alt+tab or a reboot. This is most likely caused by a window that pops up when I change the language as I use GNOME. How do I fix it?

 I have an acer aspire 7 having Intel Wi-Fi 6 AX200 . 
 iwlwifi modules are loaded and ax200 is shown as detected, dmesg doesn&#x27;t show any errors too. But iwd doesn&#x27;t detect wlan0.
 EDIT: WiFi mysteriously started working again on 5.15.43-1, no idea what caused it.

 I have tried both amdgpu and radeon
 I have disabled dynamic power management for amdgpu and radeon
 If I use DRI_PRIME&#x3D;1 glmark2, it stops at the first frame itself
 If I use DRI_PRIME&#x3D;1 glxgears, it works, till a size of window after which it freezes, radeontop shows 100 % usage.
 Also I should have 4gb of VRAM, in windows it is a shared memory between both iGPU and dGPU, but radeontop shows 2gb of VRAM
 I dont want to go through the efforts of using propietary drivers by downgrading my xorg
 What do i do ?

                              <span>After upgrading to linux-5.18 (stock kernel), nvme SSD boot time is slowed down by approximately 3 seconds compared to linux-5.17 . This happened to multiple arch installations I have.
 linux-5.18:
 793ms (kernel) + 3.851s (initrd) 
 linux-5.17:
 689ms (kernel) + 911ms (initrd) 
 The slowdown occurs when mounting the root file system.

                              <span>I was having issues connecting to my WiFi before, but I would just repeatedly try to connect and it would work eventually. This time though, when I booted my PC, my WiFi adapter is no longer recognized by the PC. Currently I&#x27;m using USB tethering with my android phone, but anyways here&#x27;s what nmcli outputs:
 nmcli device
 DEVICE TYPE STATE CONNECTION 
 enp3s0f0u1 ethernet connected Wired connection 2 
 enp9s0 ethernet unavailable -- 
 lo loopback unmanaged --
 ​
 If I recall correctly, the WiFi adapter was called wlan0, but it&#x27;s no longer here. so every time I try to connect to the WiFi with nmcli I just get &quot;Error: No Wi-Fi device found.&quot; 
 This is the WiFi adapter I&#x27;m using:
 Bus 001 Device 008: ID 0bda:c811 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. 802.11ac NIC
 I installed the corresponding WiFi drivers from the AUR a while ago when I first installed Arch:
 https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rtl8821cu-dkms-git
 ​
 I don&#x27;t think that the driver&#x27;s the problem, so I can&#x27;t think of a reason why the WIFI adapter would suddenly stop being recognized.

                              <span>Hey there!
 ​
 I updated all packages on arch, during then, kernel got updated to 5.18. After that, the system no longer loads. All I get is the dmesg buffer on the screen. When the dmesg buffer scrolls through, I noticed one message that said [FAILED] Load kernel modules. Later I chrooted into the arch install, and downgraded the linux to 5.17.9, and it works properly. Any ideas on how to fix the error?
 ​
 Thanks!

 If u have a recent intel CPU, along with Nvidia GPU, set command line parameters of the kernel - &#x27;ibt&#x3D;off&#x27;

                              <span>Google Chrome is by far the world’s most popular web browser. But with that, users have grown to have certain expectations. One of those is a dark mode.

Of course, there are still some questions about the extent to which dark themes are really better for your eyes, but it’s certainly useful in certain circumstances.
    
There are a few different ways to enable dark mode in Chrome, though weirdly it’s not quite as simple and obvious as it should be. Here’s how to do it.

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;ve 2 disks on my PC:
  
1 SSD for /root and /home (ext4)
 1 HDD for backups (etx4)
 1 HDD for data and storage (NTFS) (Its legacy from when i had dual boot with windows. Wanting to reformat as ext4 or XFS).
  
And i also have 2 active users on the PC, me and my wife.
 Is there a fancy way to have que Storage HDD mounted as, let&#x27;s say /home/shared? with full read/write access to both users if i formated as ext4 or XFS?
 Nowadays, being NTFS both users has full access to all files inside. But if I reformated as XFS or ext4 won&#x27;t permissions, user and group create conflicts between files from one user and another? I need both users to have full permissions on all disks contents.
 PS: Also, for storage like documents, music, videos, etc in that storage disk should i use XFS, ext4? or its the same any of them?

                              <span>5.18 just dropped and it isn&#x27;t booting right for me. I narrowed it down to a mirrored array in my fstab that I use as a non-boot drive. It loads fine if I downgrade to 5.17. Not sure what the issue is but if I boot 5.18 with it commented out of fstab I find that /proc/mdstat doesn&#x27;t even exist and I have manually load the module. Even if I do, an mdadm --detail --scan never finds it.
 So far I have tried the following:
  
Adding/removing mdadm and mdadm_udev from my HOOKS in mkinitcpio (neither were needed in the past as it&#x27;s a non-boot drive)
 Adding/removing mdmon to BINARIES in mkinitcpio (again, never needed in the past)
  
Heads up for anyone running a RAID and any thoughts as to what the issue might be?

                              <span>I am not asking for support for my current not-quite-Arch setup, I&#x27;m asking how much a clean install of Arch proper is going to help with general stability.
 I&#x27;ve been using an Arch derivative (EndeavourOS) for about a year now on my main PC, and I&#x27;m finding I&#x27;m really struggling with stability. This was the first Linux distro I really learned (aside from a brief stint with Kubuntu), so there&#x27;s been a lot of experimentation, mistakes, and reconfiguration done that I&#x27;ve lost track of. There&#x27;s a lot I really love about using an Arch-based distro, and I&#x27;m wondering if a clean install of Arch proper might help without having to look to another distro family.
 My main issue with this system is stability. It&#x27;s really not good. Something minor breaks twice a week. Something major breaks twice a m…</span>

                              <span>The changenotes say that Freesync would be enabled by default in Linux 5.18. I thought this meant that you didn&#x27;t have to set VariableRefresh in X11 amdgpu.conf file? It doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case on my system. Am I mis-understanding what that change is referring to?
 EDIT:
  
FreeSync Video Mode is enabled by default in 5.18, not FreeSync as a whole.

                              <span>ey guys, yesterday I left my computer on to watch a movie. After I was tired so went to sleep, but before I was going to shut down but the os wasn&#x27;t responding so I pressed the button 5 sec and went to sleep. Today, no login screen was showing and I tried a few things. 
 nomodeset and the other 2 didn&#x27;t do anything Ctrl alt f1 to f3 let me login but didn&#x27;t accept any command Runlevel3 gave me root console, but no command works, it doesn&#x27;t go past the 1st line. 
 Also, sometimes changing from f2 to f1 the login screen appears but after login just stays black and after awhile asks for login again
 What can I do?

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to Arch. I have a small amount of experience with Ubuntu, but other than that, I&#x27;m still trying to figure things out. 
 I was trying to install minecraft, but when I run the launcher from both terminal and desktop, nothing happens. 
 I got the launcher from https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/minecraft-launcher. I found multiple articles and videos that instructed me to run makepkg, and then run the package. I did all that, and now I&#x27;m lost as to why it isn&#x27;t running. 
 Terminal seems to recognize &#x27;minecraft-launcher&#x27; as a command, as it doesn&#x27;t throw any errors, but when I run &#x27;ps -au | grep minecraft&#x27;, the only process running is my command. When I run it from the desktop, I get the spinning cursor (which I imagine means it&#x27;s doing something), but then it just disappears and nothing happens.
 If someone could point me in the right direction that would be greatly appreciated.
 Thank you.

                              <span>Problem:
 Arch randomly freezes after a while (1 hour or so of use). Temps are stable (CPU around 35c, GPU around 60c). When it freezes, my music keeps playing. next song also queues up and continues. However, my mouse stops moving. I cannot use numlock/cap (the light doesn&#x27;t go on or off), and the mouse randomly starts moving after a while but then when i am moving it stops after few seconds. I am unable to click anything or do anything. It is as if the whole PC is frozen and the only thing thats working is audio. Only solution if i hard reset my PC, which obviously i do not like to do.
 ​
 Attempt:
 While scouting the net, i found something about Nvidia and PowerMizer. Mine was set to Auto/Adaptive. However, i saw something about putting it in Maximum Performance mode. I believe this to be the fix.
 ​
 Issue:
 My issue is, going to nvidia-settings and putting it on Maximum Performance does not stick. As soon as i reboot, its back to auto. Is there a way to make the setting stick even after a reboot?
 ​
 PC Info:
 CPU: I7 8700K
 RAM: 16GB
 GPU: RTX 2070 Super
 OS + Kernal: Arch Linux - 5.17.9-arch1-1
 DE/WM: KDE Plasma 5
 ​
 Thank you to all in advance for the help &lt;3
 ​
 ​
 EDIT: Possible solution? Not quite sure yet. Will report back later. PC has been on for 1 hour now without a freeze.
 What i did: On KDE autostart, i added the following line: nvidia-settings -a &quot;[gpu:0]/GpuPowerMizerMode&#x3D;1&quot;
 After rebooting, going to nvidia-settings seems to have made it stick. Thank you all for the help! I will report back here in a few hours in case nothing happens (or if something happens)

                              <span>I used to use the testing repositories and now switched to using the ALHP repos. And I was wondering if it&#x27;s generally advised to use only one of the two, or whether it&#x27;s fine, to have both in my pacman.conf.
 The idea behind it is that if one package is maybe not included in one repo pacman would then retrieve the package from the next best repo, considering all repos are in a correct order in the config file. Or does this introduce incompatibilities?
 Or doesn&#x27;t it even matter, because all packages in the ALHP repos are also in the testing repos, so packages are always retrieved from the ALHP repos and never from the testing repos?
 For example I only had AHLP and default repos (core, extra, community, multilib) active and my system up-to-date and when I also activated the testing repos (kde-unstable, testing, community-testing, multilib-testing) I get updates for a few packages.

 So I&#x27;ve managed to get PCI passthrough working for my dGPU by creating libvirt hooks that toggle me out of X before and after launching/destroying VM. This is, however, less than ideal as I wanted to use my iGPU to keep the Arch session running. No matter what I tried, it seems I am unable to use my UHD 630 (running i915) to be seen as the primary GPU for the host. I can pass through the iGPU no problem, but I cannot seem to get Arch to latch to it and reserve the dGPU for passthrough.
 dGPU is AMD. MB is MSI Gaming Pro Z390. Starting to think it&#x27;s impossible simply because my firmware forces me to boot using AMD card (cannot boot with just &quot;IGD&quot; if card is installed).
