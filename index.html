                              <span>I did a sudo pacman -Syu as I usually do and pacman was telling me nvidia-dkms and nvidia are in conflict and wants to remove nvidia. I have both because I use dkms for hardened and regular nvidia for the regular Arch kernel. I know I could blacklist the nvidia package in pacman but then it wouldn&#x27;t get updates. Should I be using dkms on the regular Arch kernel as well? Anyone run into this situation before? Thx Archerbros

                              <span>My system has been updating just fine for months daily. Starting about 2 days ago when ever I try to pacman -Syu or yay, I get that warning and it wants to remove nvidia from the target list because it conflicts with nvidia-dkms.
 I use the regular Linux kernel and have had nvidia installed for months. Choosing not to remove nvidia stops the update. I don&#x27;t remember installing nvidia-dkms. I do have steam installed and use proton often as well as lutris occasionally. So im not sure if a long time ago I followed a tutorial for dependencys and installed nvidia-dkms, but regardless the system has been running fine and still is. 
 Just worried If I select to remove nvidia it&#x27;ll mess up my graphics driver.

                              <span>I had an issue with sound and videos after a recent update
 For some reason the sound worked on system startup, I could change the volume and hear the volume change sound. However when I tried playing an mp3 or a video online it had no sound. Even the volume change sound would be gone at this point. Most videos on the internet would not play, the youtube player threw an error. but some soundless videos did manage to play on reddit
 It was the same for both Gnome and KDE. I also tried checking if the device was suddenly getting muted on alsamixer or pavucontrol, but no
 In the end I noticed the wiki had added pipewire as an alternative to pulseaudio and installing that while removing pulseaudio managed to fix all the issues 
 Did anyone else face something similar?

At a ⠀guess, it seems that it&#x27;s failing due to not having a network before trying to mount (I have the _netdev option set on the line in fstab which I thought should prevent that) and I&#x27;m not really sure what to do about it at this point. Here&#x27;s the full line from fstab: arembrandt@192.168.1.128:/homes/media /media/plex fuse.sshfs _netdev,identityfile&#x3D;/home/arembrandt/.ssh/id_rsa,defaults 0 0 My best guess is that the issue os because this device is on wifi and NetworkManager doesn&#x27;t start before things get mounted, but I can&#x27;t seem to find how I would fix that or even a way to confirm that that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>I finished the Arch Installation process, at first I was using Manjaro, then I tried out the newly updated archinstall and once I was done and booted, I decided to redo the installation but this time the traditional way. Took me about 6 hours, I was installing it on a laptop and was stuck with network configuration for a while, but once that was done the rest was relatively alright with some errors along the way. 
 Getting the systemd bootloader to run was also a bit of a pain but after I booted into Arch tty proper, just installed KDE and Xorg, Wayland and rebooted. Then I installed firefox, yay (which also was giving me errors because my mirror database was outdated already) and then I installed a GUI Pamac installer for convenience sake. I&#x27;m going to set things up more now but I&#x27;m pretty much well up and running, am pretty proud of myself rn. I can say &quot;btw I use arch&quot; no shame now :D

 Like how you use torrent pieces but on arch mirrors.

                              <span>In general, would using SW RAID 1 (mdadm) on 2 fast NVME disks give even faster random/sequential read speeds? OS can simultaneously multiplex between the disks to satisfy read requests.
 Is that correct?
 Comment. I&#x27;ve done some benchmarks, and the results are almost the same in both scenarios. Benchmarking I/O is tricky though, so asking for a more general point of view.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve recently found out that steam installed from flatpak on my machine runs games at abysmal performance (~1 FPS). A couple of weeks ago it was working fine, but I can&#x27;t pinpoint exactly when the issue appeared as I haven&#x27;t gamed for a few days.
 Steam installed natively from the repos, on the other hand, works just fine. Everything runs at the expected speed. Also desktop performance is perfectly normal.
 Has something happened recently regarding flatpaks?
 I have an nvidia gtx 1070, in case it&#x27;s an nvidia issue.

 What prompted me to think about permissions/ownership was this comment in the Arch Linux forums where it was recommended that a script run by a pacman hook be stored in /usr/local/bin presumably because it is not writable by regular user and only by root. It is implied that the concern is that regular user (not necessarily literally a person, could be malicious/buggy code running as your user) could write to the script if it were in ~/bin and that would be executable by root since one pacman is often run with root permissions and pacman hooks will execute scripts with those permissions.
 For my specific case, I want pacman to run my user script which does not need root permissions so should be r…</span>

 This seems to follow the current timeline with the pipewire-media-session migration that has been occurring. More Info Here

                              <span>I need to run a script when the battery charge reaches &gt;90%. All solutions I have found on the internet are based on a bash/python script that checks for current charge level, and it includes an infinite loop with sleep 1, or uses crontab. This seems very forceful to me, and an unnecessary use of resources. Is there nowhere in linux to catch the event of a battery charge change, and only fire the script when it does? I am using KDE if it matters.
 Why do I even need this? I would like to stop the battery charging when it reaches 90%. My Lenovo Legion 5 laptop has this option in the firmware, but it only stops at 60%, and there is no way to change this limit (which can be done on ThinkPads). My goal is to enable this option when it reaches 90%. (Which is greater than 60% and the firmware will stop charging)

 I have a Nvidia GPU, and i tried both kernel but i don&#x27;t find differences between them.
 Is it still useful for gaming purposes to install the zen kernel ? Or the Vanilla kernel does the same job now ?

 I&#x27;m on Xorg, XFCE. GPU is Radeon HD 7790, driver is radeon. GPU acceleration and hardware decoding in Steam&#x27;s settings are enabled.

                              <span>hi, so I successfully installed Arch Linux using a USB boot drive, but I forgot to install netctl or any other internet package alongside it. As a result, I now have no internet in Arch, I can&#x27;t install it within arch because I need internet to install a package (catch 22). After looking around, I found that I could chroot into arch from my USB boot which had internet and then use Pacstrap to install netctl. However, I don&#x27;t know which directory to chroot into?

                              <span>I really like the idea of arch. The appeal to me is probably the same appeal to everyone else: complete customizeability, community-driven, fun to tinker with, etc.
 But I&#x27;m very much new to the Linux world and don&#x27;t really know what sort of things Arch does that other don&#x27;t, nor what I&#x27;m giving up by going Arch over other distributions.
 For example, I play League of Legends. The traditional way of getting League on Linux is through Play On Linux with a special Wine version. Is that something that&#x27;s doable on Arch?
 Are all Proton Steam games available on Arch in a streamlined/easy way? Meaning, I just install steam, select the &quot;proton experimental&quot; button and suddenly I can download Apex Legends? Or are there more steps?
 Are there any difficulties with peripherals? Is my mouse/headset/Blue Yeti going to work easily?
 In short, am I giving up any software accessibility by going Arch or is everything that&#x27;s available on other Linux distributions mostly available on Arch?
 And how difficult is the installation process *truly*? I get that it&#x27;s supposedly difficult, but is it so difficult that even following a guide wouldn&#x27;t be sufficient to get it installed correctly the first time?
 Thanks!
 ​
 Strong edit for some things I want to do on Linux:
  
Play League of Legends/Battle.net games/Steam Proton games.
 Install i3 Window Tiling Manager
 Custom keybinds
 Install Unreal Engine
 Vim

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying my first install of Arch, i downloaded the iso from the wiki, flashed it on a drive, ran archinstall.
 I got a minimum install, grub as the booter, pipewire, set it to only mount one of my drives and auto config my partitions. Only firefox and vim as additional packages.
 Install went smooth, no errors. I rebooted and instead of finding myself on a bare minimum login screen I was on a command line asking for my user and password.
 I though that the minimum install would give me a desktop environment so I just though that I should reboot and reinstall with kde as an aditional package and I would be golden.
 That&#x27;s when things went wrong.
 Firstly the bios refused to show up, the pc was dead. I tried reseting a few times while waiting a few minutes and nothing.
 Then out of nowhere, while doing some research of my phone on what I might have done wrong the bios showed up. The install must have done something weird to my sistem so I tried booting on the flashdrive again so I could reinstall Arch and try checking what I&#x27;ve done wrong.
 But it is soooo, sloooow, like, it takes minutes to leave the boot screen. Right now I&#x27;ve been waiting for the flashdrive to boot, it&#x27;s so slow that I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s worlking or stuck. When I press delete it instantle goes to the bios config screen so it is still respondive.
 Edit: I was able to get to the install again by restoring default bios config and booting the flash drive. Do you guys have any idea of what&#x27;s going on? I might have made a mistake while configuring the disk layout, I&#x27;m having a hard time making heads or tailsof whats going on in the install, so my plan is to let it do what it want on the drive I want the system to be, and set the rest on a graphical interface later.

                              <span>Hi, I am looking for an equivalent of MX-Snapshot on arch which would allow to create an ISO like a carbon copy of my entire system w/ apps, settings that I can just reuse on another system and have everything again. Does it exist on Arch?

 ip link only returns only 1: lo: ... (not the wlan0 I want)

 lspci -k returns a bunch of stuff along with Network Controller: Qualcomm Atheros... w/ ath11k_pci kernel driver.
 I haven&#x27;t figured out why my network interface is not listed. It seems to me I can detect the wireless adapter and the driver is installed. Not sure how to proceed. HALP.

                              <span>My work is making me install one of those IT security management agents which auto-updates your packages or whatever. I do not feel like having a monitoring process watching over me the entire time and I&#x27;ve been looking to separate my personal/work files into two contexts anyway.
 Has anybody dual-booted two different, independent Arch OSes on one machine and is willing to share the process so I can save myself an evening and a lot of googling?

                              <span>Hi,
 Im looking for a way to encrypt my drive using Arch to where whenever my device goes to sleep or gets locked it also locks the disk. Would it be possible to also have a thumb drive to open it as an alternative method ? I already have Arch installed and am not willing to reinstall just for encryption (I was looking at some guides and they were about installing WITH disk encryption). I feel comfortable with Arch after starting last August but still do need some help here and there, this is definitely one of those areas. Im getting much better over time though so thx everyone :p
 Thanks so much!

 Also this might be odd but is there any way to open the other browser which i have if the password is incorrect 
 ​
 ps: i have removed password from my user using passwd -d and please don&#x27;t suggest to just use that cause I don&#x27;t want to change this.

- Arch Wiki has me a bit confused. I have Windows10 installed UEFI/NTFS on one drive (M.2). I have a spare SATA drive I want to put Arch on. If I choose the SATA drive during Arch install will it just work? The bit about UEFI/MBR/GPT has me a bit confused. 
  
Any advice is most appreciated. I generally go by the &quot;learn by doing&quot; mantra, but I can do without having to redo Windows. I just did it fresh, like a few hours ago. 
 Thanks.

                              <span>[Not really solved, but I&#x27;ve realized that for reasons outside of this issue that Windows fits me better for now. This mainly comes down to compatibility as well as most of my friends playing Valorant. Thanks for the help either way.]
 ​
 As the title says, they don&#x27;t seem to be working. Games run extremely poorly and it seems to not be utilizing my GPU at all.
 pacman -Qs nvidia tells me I have nvidia-utils, nvidia-settings, nvidia, libxnvctrl and libvdpau installed
 Neofetch tells me I have a &quot;RTX 206&quot; instead of 2060 for some reason
 I&#x27;m honestly not sure what to do here, how do I fix this? if I need to provide any other info please let me know

                              <span>I started my linux journey with Ubuntu back in &#x27;08. It was wonderfully freeing. Later on down the road I started trying new distros. I didn&#x27;t really give Arch a chance until around 2012 and it was quite a bit different back then. But one thing I loved was the documentation and how much it taught me about linux and maintaining the system itself. Using Ubuntu was freeing but it also felt like I didn&#x27;t really get what was going on under the surface because I didn&#x27;t really have a hand to play in any of it.
 So that&#x27;s a really long-winded way to start this post but my main question for you all is - what could Gentoo teach me? Is there any advantage? I don&#x27;t know if I would stick with it for long and it&#x27;s not like I want to switch away from Arch but I&#x27;m thinking that maybe it would be able to help teach me a few things if I tried it for a while. Am I completely off-base here? Or does anybody that has tried both have any input on this? I appreciate any replies.

                              <span>Uno dei programmi storicamente più apprezzati dagli utenti di Windows era certamente CCleaner. Usiamo l&#x27;imperfetto perché, nonostante l&#x27;applicazione vantasse ottime recensioni fin dalla data di debutto della prima versione, nel lontano 2003, tra il 2018 e il 2019 qualcosa si è rotto nel rapporto con gli utenti.A metà del 2017 Avast acquisì Piriform ovvero la software house sviluppatrice di CCleaner e di altre note utilità. L&#x27;anno seguente un gruppo di criminali informatici riuscì a sostituire la versione originale dell&#x27;applicazione con una dannosa agendo sui server dell&#x27;azienda e nel 2020 destò scalpore la raccolta di dati effettuata senza il consenso degli utenti.Da allora Piriform assunse un impegno preciso e spiegò che avrebbe risolto ogni problematica in sospeso cercando di riguadagnare la fiducia degli utenti.Dopo i precedenti &#x27;scivoloni&#x27;, CCleaner è tornato un software decisamente più affidabile anche se la mancata condivisione del codice sorgente (non è un progetto open source) resta un problema per molti utenti.CCleaner 6.0 è l&#x27;ultima versione del software che Piriform ha appena iniziato a distribuire attraverso i suoi server: l&#x27;abbiamo provata e al momento non viene proposta l&#x27;installazione di alcun software aggiuntivo o potenzialmente inutile come accaduto in passato e come segnalava lo stesso Microsoft Defender.</span>

                              <span>Il primo grande pacchetto di aggiornamento destinato al più recente sistema operativo Microsoft, Windows 11 22H2 verrà rilasciato con buona probabilità già entro la fine dell&#x27;estate 2022. In un altro articolo abbiamo descritto le principali novità di Windows 11 22H2.Microsoft sta però già guardando oltre e se le funzionalità di Windows 11 22H2 sono ormai &#x27;congelate&#x27; adesso si comincia a parlare delle innovazioni che verranno introdotte in tempi successivi.In una nota pubblicata sul blog ufficiale dell&#x27;azienda, Amanda Langowski e Brandon LeBlanc hanno presentato Azioni suggerite o Suggested actions in inglese.Si tratta di una funzionalità attiva a livello di sistema che consente di riconoscere le informazioni selezionate con il cursore o il puntatore del mouse o del touchpad.Si supponga di evidenziare un numero di telefono: Windows 11 lo riconoscerà e permetterà di chiamarlo usando le applicazioni supportate oppure di aggiungerlo in rubrica.

Stessa cosa per date e orari: selezionandoli il sistema operativo chiederà all&#x27;utente se aggiungere un&#x27;attività nel calendario, avviare una pianificazione con Outlook oppure con altre applicazioni compatibili.Al momento le Azioni suggerite possono essere provate solo dagli utenti statunitensi iscritti al canale Dev del programma Windows Insider di Windows 11.</span>
