                              <span>Player stats are a staple metric in video games, so why aren’t they front and center on your Steam profile? Moreover, you’re probably looking for the best deals on the titles you want to play. Luckily, there are free third-party tools and websites to see how much you’re spending money- and time-wise on Steam and find the best prices on games. To do this, you need to find your Steam ID and set your profile to public.

I have some scripts which reset a GPU which I passthrough to a VM which seem to have stopped working. I get either &quot;permission denied&quot; even with sudo, or the shell locks up and doesn&#x27;t even respond properly to Ctrl+C. When I shut down the machine it also hangs indefinitely waiting for a virtualisation demon stop job to complete. Anyone seen this or have any ideas?

 Not sure whether I shouldn&#x27;t delete that signature. Would it be safe to not delete it?

I have installed mopidy and mopidy-mpd and configured it as the docs says but when I start ncmpcpp it says &#x27;connection refused&#x27;, but then, if I start ncpmcpp as sudo or with the flag -h 127.0.0.1 (Host which ncmpcpp should supposedly already connect because I have it like that in the config files) it connects, but the sound has a lot of latency, like one to two seconds (which I suspect it has to do with pipewire but idk), for example when I try to lower the volume it lags and two secones later it lowers the volume... I would really appreciate your help as I would like to set up mopidy-spotify later down the line. Thanks for reading!!

                              <span>Link. The maintainer is still active on other packages, having updated them even up to this month this year. This make me wonder if there has been no need for them to update that package since.
 Or maybe they got a new printer so don&#x27;t care about it any more. Often you will see a note on the aur comments if a maintainer is abandoning a package though.
 Any other clues as to whether I should try this one or repackage myself?

                              <span>Installing XFCE with archinstall, I can see only two icon sets present: Adwaita and HighContrast. I think Adwaita icons look good enough, but the problem is that it lacks a lot of icons for WhiskerMenu or the default image viewer tool bar. If I set the icon set to &quot;HighContrast&quot;, all those missing icons are displayed, but the high contrast icons look ugly. I have tested it with EndeavourOS and its default icon set was Qogir. If I change it to Adwaita, I can see missing icons there, too.
 I think I could find some different icon sets from the Internet, but I think the default Adwaita looks good enough. Can I keep Adwaita and add missing icons? Or using another icon set is the sane solution?

                              <span>I already posted this in the Arch forum, but didn&#x27;t receive an answer, so I&#x27;ll try again here. What follows is a copy and paste of that post:
 I use a USB-C hub with two HDMI slots, and the second monitor won&#x27;t turn on. Or, If I explicitely try to enable it via wdisplay, it will only work with a resolution of 720x400. I run wayland and sway. My laptop has an Intel gpu and a dedicated nvidia GPU for which I use nouveau. But I&#x27;m pretty sure, that the nvidia GPU is not involved with the external monitors.
 I&#x27;m not sure if this is a problem with Sway, Wayland, the intel driver, or my system configuration which is why I ask for help here.
 In the sway log, there is this regarding the issue:
  00:00:03.894 [DEBUG] [sway/desktop/output.c:857] New output 0x556dc7c04a80: DP-5 (non-desktop: 0) 00:00…</span>

                              <span>Whenever I boot up my arch linux and log in to LXDE, it always boots up and works properly. Whenever I put it into suspension (by closing the lid) it goes into suspension like expected. However, whenever I open the lid back up and start using it again, it starts like normal but then just randomly goes into suspension at random moments and the only fix so far is to reboot but i don’t want to have to keep doing that. I also like lxde. How do i fix this?
 Hardware:
 •Razor Blade 15
 •Nvidia Gpu
 I’ve tried:
 •Reading the troubleshooting manual (nothing seen)
 •booting without quiet (nothing unusual)
 •Looking through the configs
 •Updating the system
 NOTE: When installing lxde, I installed it as/is with nothing additional. Also I had this issue from as early as the first time closing the lid.

                              <span>I’d like to preface this by saying that this is my first real experience with any Linux installation, and I just followed the wiki to the best of my ability to get to where I’m at.
 I want a dual booting system with Windows 11 and Arch Linux. I followed the Arch Linux installation guide very closely. I mounted Windows’ EFI partition to /boot, and the “Microsoft basic data” to /mnt/win11 to have access to those files while in Arch. Ran grub-mkconfig with os-prober, and rebooted, to be greeted with GRUB showing me only Arch Linux, not Windows.
 On booting Arch, I get: Starting version 250.4-2-arch /dev/nvme0n1p6: clean, 40974/3972672 files, 729772/15859712 blocks [FAILED] Failed to mount /win11. [DEFEND] Dependency failed for Local File Systems. You are in emergency mode. After logging in, type “journalctl -xb” to view system logs, “systemctl reboot” to reboot, “systemctl default” or “exit” to boot into default mode.
 I tried looking it up but all I could find were problems regarding Arch, not a dual boot system. Any suggestions on how to get Windows booting? Thanks as always

                              <span>OK, OK, The Wiki already mention this, but I think this would / could help someone more! 😉 When installing Arch on a laptop with the integrated Intel GMA 4500MHD GPU, please remember:
  
modesetting is OK, no need to install xf86-video-intel (unless you&#x27;re facing some HW acceleration issues)
 there&#x27;s no need to create a configuration file in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/
 also add intel_agp inside MODULES&#x3D;(... intel_agp i915 ...)
 my laptop&#x27;s screen died, so I&#x27;m outputting the video via the VGA port only... Then this option comes in handy: video&#x3D;LVDS-1:d in the kernel command line parameter in the bootloader.

I am able to read and open those partitions but I am not able to make any changes in the folders whatsoever. I some yt video about doing sudo mount -o remount /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1 and I was able to convert the partition as &#x27;rw&#x27; when I enter sudo mount in the terminal but I am still not able to make any changes there. Also when I rebooted the laptop, it just went back to &#x27;ro&#x27; and I tried doing it again but it didn&#x27;t work.

 What to do ?

                              <span>I&#x27;m relatively new to Arch Linux, but am looking for help on how to fix this issue.
 When i try to open Qutebrowser I receive the following:
 Fatal error: PyQt5.QtCore is required to run qutebrowser but could not be imported! Maybe it&#x27;s not installed?
 ​
 The error encountered was:
 libicui18n.so.67: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
 ​
 Please search for the python3 version of PyQt5.QtCore in your distributions packages, or see https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/master/doc/install.asciidoc
 ​
 If you installed a qutebrowser package for your distribution, please report this as a bug.
 ​
 What I&#x27;ve tried so far:
 Installing qutebrowser from the official &amp; the git option
 reinstalling python, pyqt5, icu 
 Running a debug from https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/master/doc/stacktrace.asciidoc#archlinux
 ​
 Any help or insight would be great.

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve had this trouble with my Lenovo IdeaPad 5 14ARE05 (AMD) for it has to be at least half a year. When I leave/close my laptop it goes to sleep and everything stays running, but when I attempt to wake up the screen (like with the use of a click of a mouse or key) nothing happens. The only time I&#x27;ve been able to solve this is by upgrading my system to a newer version, but this doesn&#x27;t last for very long. I was thinking it could maybe be something to do with the drivers, but all of them are for windows.

 PC specs:
 Kernel: 5.17.4-archl-l

 All help is appreciated :)

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a new install of an arch spin (endeavour) on my asus vivobook (x513ua), and the touchpad (which xinput informs me is an ELAN1300) intermittently freezes/stops inputting, and then resumes working. This occurs more frequently when the laptop is heating up, and exactly how long and how frequently it freezes for varies.
 I&#x27;ve looked online for answers, but nothing I found seems to work. Any ideas?

As such it&#x27;s hard to assess the current Linux driver support level and with no clear communication from Intel on the matter. Intel has been working on their upstream DG2/Alchemist support for a while but it looks like with the Linux 5.19 kernel this summer is what will likely be their base version requirement for the DG2/Alchemist-based Intel GPUs...</span>

                              <span>Back in 2020 file-system driver provider Paragon Software announced they wanted to upstream their NTFS driver into the Linux kernel. This driver was previously a proprietary, commercial offering from the company but given the state of NTFS these days they wanted to upstream this driver with full read/write support and other features not found within the existing NTFS driver. Finally last year after going through many rounds of review, the new driver was merged into Linux 5.15. Sadly, less than one year later, concerns have been raised that the driver is already effectively orphaned and not being maintained...</span>

That was dropped though due to not enough randomness at boot for some platforms like Arm 32-bit, Motorola m68k, Microblaze, Xtensa, and others. But then the change went in to opportunistically initialize /dev/random as a best-effort approach where it at least works nicely on x86/x86_64. The good news is that original unification effort may be re-visited in the future now that the original blocker issue has been addressed...</span>

                              <span>L&#x27;emulatore di Android messo a disposizione da Google è sicuramente il migliore che possiamo trovare dato che quasi ogni app rilasciata sul PlayStore è stata molto probabilmente testata proprio su questo programma. Di solito fa parte della suite Android Studio che contiene tutti i componenti e i programmi necessari per creare app per Android ma se vogliamo solo l&#x27;emulatore e poco altro è possibile averlo senza per forza installare tutta la suite. Dato che sarà un installazione minimale, dovremo utilizzare la linea di comando per configurare e avviare l&#x27;emulatore, il che non è affatto un male perché questo metodo di interazione con il computer è uno dei più efficienti che ci sia!

                              <span>Windows devices have a variety of system and app notifications (sometimes incorrectly called program pop-ups) that alert you about events happening in real time. Be it incoming VoIP calls, Outlook calendar reminders, or frequent prompts for a Windows version update, they might all seem equally urgent.
    
However that’s not always the case; and even if it were, any user action required from you can easily wait a bit longer. Notifications can be especially annoying when you’re hard at work or enjoying your favorite game or TV show.
    
To stop these alerts from being intrusive, we recommend disabling them, hiding them temporarily, or enabling only the important ones. We’ll show you how to do disable computer notifications on Windows.

                              <span>The solid state drive has given us a leap forward in the ability to open applications and read files quickly. Its storage mechanism operates under the same principles that other flash storage mediums use, namely non-volatile memory, which prevents memory from disappearing due to loss of power like it does in RAM. Since both SD cards and SSDs use solid-state storage and have no moving parts, is there any notable difference between the two types of memory? Shouldn’t a massive-capacity SD card be just about the same thing as a small SSD?

Alcuni comportamenti posti in essere dai file e dai processi in esecuzione sul sistema, cioè, possono essere la spia di un&#x27;attività malevola.Nei test di AV-Comparatives Defender ha ottenuto una valutazione bassa per quanto riguarda il riconoscimento delle minacce usano esclusivamente la scansione online.</span>

Manhattan, leader nello sviluppo di tecnologie smart e dispositivi capaci di assicurare elevate prestazioni, presenta un&#x27;ampia selezione di nuovi cavi audio Hi-Fi Premium per il trasporto di flussi audio senza la minima perdita di qualità.Dai cavi adattatori jack stereo da 3,5 mm per collegare cuffie e microfoni ai cavi ottici digitali TOSLINK per ricevitori AV, soundbar, TV, PC, DAC, Playstation e Xbox, sino ai cavi audio stereo Hi-Fi Premium per altoparlanti, casse, tablet e laptop.Tutti i prodotti sono realizzati con una guaina altamente flessibile, resistente e con contatti placcati in oro 24K per un&#x27;ottima resa sonora e una lunga durata nel tempo.Indispensabili per il collegamento di cuffie, microfono e altoparlanti a dispositivi come smartphone, laptop e tablet, PlayStation, Xbox e altri device sono i nuovi cavi adattatori con splitter audio e stereo AUX da 3,5 mm.In particolare, il modello ICOC 35H-1F2M-015 è dotato di un connettore femmina a due maschi stereo da 3,5 mm e consente di &#x27;splittare&#x27; una connessione audio singola permettendo per esempio di collegare una cuffia con singolo plug da 3,5 mm ad un laptop o un PC dotato di porta separata per microfono e speaker.

Il modello ICOC 35H-1M2F-020 è invece dotato di un connettore maschio e due femmina stereo da 3,5 mm.Esso permette la connessione a smartphone, laptop, tablet, iPad, iPod e lettori MP3 con un singolo jack stereo ottenendo in uscita due jack per cuffia e microfono.

Il modello ICOC 35H-1M2F-015 è anch&#x27;esso dotato di un connettore jack maschio e di due connettori femmina da 3,5 mm per il collegamento di due cuffie o auricolari sfruttando una singola porta di uscita audio.</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m try to set my fans to 30% speed when my machine boots
 I&#x27;ve been using nvidia-settings to do it via CLI and even set up a small script to do a fan profile for me every changing every ~5C (before I discovered GreenWithEnvy )
 I&#x27;m using SDDM with Plasma. I tried adding the below to my /usr/share/sddm/scripts/Xsession
 nvidia-settings -a &quot;[gpu:0]/GPUFanControlState&#x3D;1&quot; -a &quot;[fan:0]/GPUTargetFanSpeed&#x3D;30&quot; -a &quot;[fan:1]/GPUTargetFanSpeed&#x3D;30&quot; 
 It doesn&#x27;t seem to activate when SDDM starts. It seems like nvidia-settings doesn&#x27;t run at all unless a user is logged in graphically. To confirm this, I logged in to tty2 after SDDM started and was sitting at the user login screen. I ran nvidia-settings and it failed, however after adding DISPLAY&#x3D;:0, it failes with a different error about MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE missing.
 Both of those are kind of beside the problem though. If this was a headless server that wasn&#x27;t running X, how would I go about using nvidia-settings to set the fanspeed?

                              <span>I have switched to using zsh on my arch machine, I&#x27;m used to bash and find bash-completion really useful, specially when using pacman. I have installed zsh-completions but it does not give completions for pacman. Is it possible to get them with zsh?

 Edit: Or even better, complete commands like Fish does.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to share over wifi my ethernet connection, and have followed the &quot;Software access point&quot; tutorial on the wiki.
 I&#x27;ve created the wifi link layer without any issues, and managed to connect to it with my phone.
 I set up the NAT with iptables, copying pasting the commands from the wiki without understanding them very well. I substituted the interface names where necessary.
 The manual IP assignment is a bit mysterious on the wiki, so here is how I interpreted it:
 sudo ip address add 192.168.123.105/24 broadcast + dev wlo1 
 Where 192.168.123.105 is the IP address I wish for my phone to connect with.
 On my phone, I connected with the static IP setting, and chose this address and configured the DNS to 1.1.1.1.
 However, my phone says &quot;No internet access&quot; once it has connected to the access point. What did I do wrong and how can I troubleshoot it? Thanks in advance!

Is it possible to have both drivers installed at the same time or will that mess up my installation?

                              <span>Several of my packages would get the error where their not installed correctly because they exist while also not existing.
 Zsh required me to manually remove all zsh files from /usr to even reinstall zsh.
 For vtk I had able to use a pacman --overwrite.
 I needed those two packages for work which I can start about almost 5 hours later than expected now. Im assuming many other packages are screwed as well.
 Running pacman -Qkk gives me hundreds of warnings. And used to give an error for vtk.
 How did something like this even happen. Now that it has happened how can I fix it wthout creating a long delay again.

 [bb@bbc ~]$ groups sys network power lxd lp wheel bb [bb@bbc ~]$ whoami bb [bb@bbc ~]$ su bb Password: [bb@bbc ~]$ groups sys network power lxd uucp lp wheel bb 
 I&#x27;ve tried logging out completely, but the issue remains. The new group config apparently just isn&#x27;t loaded for the user until I su. It also gets unloaded afterwards:
 [bb@bbc ~]$ groups sys network power lxd uucp lp wheel bb [bb@bbc ~]$ exit exit [bb@bbc ~]$ groups sys network power lxd lp wheel bb [bb@bbc ~]$ groups bb wheel lp uucp sys network power lxd bb 
 Did I miss a step to make Linux parse the config after usermod -a -G?

                              <span>Ok. What the hell. Ive gone through 5 installation attempts and didnt sleep for 2 days because I liked the neofetch icon. I know. Then I configured Realtek adapter to work so I feel like there&#x60;s nothing I cant fix now. Ive been running the system for a few days now and did a lot of customization. But when I told my experienced friend about it he said Arch is an unnecessarily complex system and I should just switch to Ubuntu because its kernel has more lines or something and so it is better. Thoguhts?

                              <span>I have a Dell XPS 15 9500, with an nvidia graphcis card. I&#x27;ve had an issue for a while where my laptop isn&#x27;t able to recover from suspend (either triggered directly via systemctl suspend, or by closing the laptop lid). After suspend, no input given to the laptop will cause the display to turn back on. The only thing I&#x27;m able to do is press the power button to turn the laptop off.
 Update: initially my kernel modules in /etc/mkinitcpio.conf were
 MODULES&#x3D;(intel_agp i915 nvidia nvidia_modeset nvidia_uvm nvidia_drm) 
 I haven&#x27;t tried every combination of these, but using
 MODULES&#x3D;() 
 allows for recovering from suspend, although this seems like a bad idea

                              <span>I would like to use the entire disk of my HP Elitebook (Intel i5-7300U @ 2.60GHz) to install Arch. Currently it contains Windows 10. I&#x27;ve read the install guide. It recommended to use the existing EFI partition (&quot;If the disk from which you want to boot already has an EFI system partition, do not create another one, but use the existing partition instead.&quot;) 
 A few lines further down, in the example layout, the suggested minimum size for this partition is 300 Mb. I&#x27;m confused, because my existing partition is 99 Mb (see below). I would much rather start with a clean slate.
 So my question is twofold: can I ignore this advice about the existing EFI partition and what is the best way to start with an empty disk? And as an aside: do I need EFI at all?

                              <span>Gaming headphones are an essential bit of kit if you crave full immersion and comms with other players in MPGs. The only downside for me has always been the permanent mic stalk, as any gaming headset looks silly on the train or at times they’re used for your phone or other device. The EKSA E900 Pro Gaming Headset gets around this limitation in a couple of interesting ways and produces a set of headphones that are very decent in quality while being versatile as well. They score well in other areas too.

Nice Pro Features
    
Unboxing the EKSA E900 Pro headphones, you will find a nice chunky pair of gaming headphones with LEDs embedded on the outside of the earpieces, so you look super-cool in Zoom chats, but they also have some nice pro features. The mic is detachable, and although the headset is designed primarily to work via USB, you also have an additional cable... Read more</span>

                              <span>Gentoo is a powerful and flexible Linux distribution. With its innovative package manager – Portage – it allows you to sculpt your computer system down to its most basic parts.
    
This is because Gentoo, by default, requires you to compile all the packages that you want to install. That approach allows you to change compile-time settings. This includes settings for various technologies which would not have been possible in a binary-based distribution.
