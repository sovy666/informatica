 Right now i&#x27;ve gotten a new laptop (ZephyrusG14) and insalled arch, i use awesomeWM. 
 The problem i&#x27;m having is that when a i load X11, awesome does not show any icon and if i try to launch ulauncher, &quot;nitrogen --restore&quot; or any kind of explorer window (i.e. open file on chromium) it chrashes and does nothing.
 Both ulauncher and Nitrogen give a mesage regarding PixBuff:
 Nitrogen:

 terminate called after throwing an instance of &#x27;Gdk::PixbufError&#x27;
 zsh: IOT instruction (core dumped) nitrogen --restore

 Ulauncher:

                              <span>Usually I just install endevourOS because it takes less time and apparently it preconfigures most stuff (firewall for example) but I&#x27;m considering a fresh install of vanilla arch just to reduce bloat and preinstalled software. Is there anything that I should sure to set-up or configure after the install process (besides a window manager and firewall etc.) Or is it just an install it and your good to go type of thing?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently on Windows 10, on a laptop with 2 drives: a 120GB SSD and 1TB HDD. I&#x27;ve done a few installations on virtual machines, so I&#x27;m familiar with the normal process. However, when I eventually do my actual installation, I want to (1) have access to both drives and (2) keep all the data that&#x27;s currently on the hard drive. How do I achieve this?
 I&#x27;ve looked around for answers but I&#x27;m still not sure, and I want to be absolutely certain before trying anything.

                              <span>Hi, I am new to arch. Pamac is a great help if you want to get app installations fast done. Unfortunately, pamac with snap and flatpak support is somehow broken. I can install only pamac-aur. Is there a possibility to upgrade pamac afterwards? Thanks for any advice in advance.

                              <span>Installing was effortless with archinstall script, picked Gnome as desktop. Everything left at default and went smoothly, normal kernel.
 These were my first 5 minutes into it:
 - Opening a terminal, keyboard layout is not the one I just set at install time
 - Gnome settings open just fine but wallpaper changer doesn&#x27;t work. Theme changer from light to dark isn&#x27;t working either.
 - I try launching Gnome Tweaks from the Gnome Launche but it doesn&#x27;t launch anything.
 - I go back to the Terminal to at least enlarge the font, however the &#x27;Custom font&#x27; checkbox isn&#x27;t working at all, despite being clickable.
 - I try to document all of this for a friend but the Gnome recorder (CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+R) stops recording at random in the first 10 seconds
 - Trying to &quot;Pin to dash&quot; Terminal doesn&#x27;t actually pin anything
 Nothing of this is important but sets the mood for everything else, pretty much leaves me wondering what else could be broken and made me instantly drop my idea about switching to Arch in my main rig. The iso used was archlinux-2022.04.05-x86_64.iso
 New user experience aside, what could be causing all of this?

                              <span>So, let&#x27;s give some details (or rather, all the details I can afford to give).
 Basically, last night I updated my install (yes, using sudo pacman -Syu and I do update it somewhat often btw) before turning off my PC and everything seemed to work. Yet, now in the next day, I can enter the grub, yes, but after selecting to boot Arch (be it the Linux Kernel or the Linux-Zen one) and it seems to load normally but then it simply remains pitch black. And no, it&#x27;s not just the graphical user interface, I can&#x27;t bring the terminal up either.
 So, I tried using my installation media on a stick to repair, but weirdly it doesn&#x27;t seem to boot either. I can select it from the boot menu on the bios, and it does boot into the &quot;options&quot; (install UEFI, install UEFI with voice, RAM etc.) but it doesn&#x27;t matter what I select, it too seems to fail to boot.
 I am no &quot;arch newbie&quot;, been using it for a year or so now, but I am really lost here, I suspect (but I hope it&#x27;s not) something hardware-related at this point
 EDIT: Update, was able to enter the installation media by booting it on legacy mode and using the load into RAM option
 EDIT2: Ok, was able to chroot by doing so, updated the system once again via sudo pacman -Syu something with a package called libvterm broke but now it&#x27;s fixed. Install repaired, problem solved. Feel free to point out to this thread as a possible solution for others.

                              <span>Hello, I just set up an Arch server that will have some VMs permanently running on it.
 ​
 I thought that shutting down the host would gracefully handle the VMs but i don&#x27;t think it does, as soon as I pass the shutdown -h now command, the VM networks drop (I am pinging to check).
 ​
 Then, after I reboot the host, the VMs go through a full boot. I think the system is just forcing the VMs off, the whole process feels way too fast.
 ​
 I found the libvirt-guests.service in the Wiki, but there is no mention of how to use it and the /etc/conf.d/libvirt-guests file that it says to read does not exist.
 ​
 Can I have some help on this please? Thank you!

                              <span>Hello, all.
 Normally I run updates once a day, so I know that it&#x27;s unusual that for 2 days in a row, pacman tells me that all repositories (including some testing) are up-to-date. I have edited my mirrorlist a couple of times to try different servers with the same result.
 Does anyone know what&#x27;s going on? Is the Arch team on vacation? Does this have something to do with the reports of web servers being down? Something else?

 I&#x27;ve created a small AUR helper that builds packages in docker containers.
 Just wanted to know your thoughts. Feature ideas are welcome!

                              <span>Hi guys! 
 Question about installing Arch Linux. I own an HP Pavilion Aero 13 laptop. Here is my configuration:
 Model: 13-be0006ur
 CPU: Ryzen 5 5600U (15W)
 RAM: 16GB
 SSD: 512GB
 Display: 13&quot; IPS 2560x1600
 WiFi: Realtek 8852AE
 When installing Arch Linux, it is not possible to connect to Wi-Fi because there is no driver for Realtek 8852AE. There is no Ethernet port and the iPhone is used as a modem via USB. But Arch Linux doesn&#x27;t see the iPhone, as far as I know, because when connecting via USB the iPhone needs to use iTunes as a modem. Can you tell me how to install the driver then and install Arch Linux? Do I need to look for an Android phone? I&#x27;m confused and can&#x27;t solve this problem. I would appreciate your help!

                              <span>Hello everybody, hope y&#x27;all doing great, so I happened to run into this issue with any Java application in dwm where the window doesn&#x27;t render anything and only displays a blank grey window. Now I have read the wiki and tried the three fix I had found.
 wmname, AWT_TOOLKIT&#x3D;MToolkit, _JAVA_AWT_NONREPARENTING&#x3D;1
 None of these seems to work for whatever reason and I couldn&#x27;t find anything else other than this.
 I have jdk8 and jdk18 installed on my system, any help would be useful.
 [Solved]

                              <span>Hey, i would really like to know if there is a nice and easy way to cleanup my arch installation. By cleanup i mean that i want to uninstall everything that is unecassary. 
 I know the commands yay -Q and pacman -Q but when i look at everything that is installed i have no clue what i can simply uninstall and what is important and should not be uninstalled.
 Also i would like to know how to cleanup my drive, for example in windows i could simply clear the temp folder - is there something similar in arch?

 ​
 I&#x27;m trying to get Matlab 2022a to run on my Arch install. I&#x27;ve read the wiki and managed to get the program to install and launch. However, once the program starts, there are icons but no text. It looks like everything graphically is there except for the text only. I&#x27;m not sure what information is helpful for diagnosing this, so please let me know what info to share!
 ​
 Thanks!

 It became interesting to me and I decided to try one of the console file managers.
 But there are so many!
 What is your favorite file manager that you can recommend?
 I really need that file manager that I can flexibly customize and see images in my directories (Like in nautilus: https://i.imgur.com/IYj1qfD.png).

                              <span>my secondary LDM hard drive was working fine after i had my friend help me mount it. for some reason now the mount stopped working, now it doesn&#x27;t show anything. like the folder is still there, but there&#x27;s nothing in it and umount tells me it&#x27;s not mounted in the first place.
 ​
 mounting it gives me wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb1, missing codepage or helper program, or other error. i fixed it once by completely shutting of my windows partition, but i didn&#x27;t touch it ever since i first mounted the drive. no luck searching stuff. any help?
 ​
 tldr: LDM mount no worky anymore how fix?
 edit: Microsoft LDM Partition is the full name thought there was only one LDM :/

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had to drop back to Fedora this past week because I can&#x27;t connect my preferred Bluetooth headphones under Arch (an MPOW BH408 receiver that I&#x27;m using while I wait for a new headset). I get the following error in bluetoothctl in which it appears to try connecting three times in rapid succession and then give up:
  Agent registered [bluetooth]# devices Device E3:28:E9:24:30:BA MPOW BH408 Device 20:19:09:37:F6:D9 U8I [bluetooth]# connect E3:28:E9:24:30:BA Attempting to connect to E3:28:E9:24:30:BA [CHG] Device E3:28:E9:24:30:BA Connected: yes Failed to connect: org.bluez.Error.Failed br-connection-canceled [CHG] Device E3:28:E9:24:30:BA Connected: no [CHG] Device E3:28:E9:24:30:BA Connected: yes [CHG] Device E3:28:E9:24:30:BA Connected: no [CHG] Device E3:28:E9:24:30:BA Connected: yes [CHG] Device E3:28:E9:24:30:BA Connected: no [bluetooth]# quit 
 What&#x27;s weird is that the other device listed in bluetoothctl (my backup headset) connects without an issue (just bad sound as per the usual with this model), so it appears to be related to the particular combination of the version of Bluez and the MPOW BH408. It works under the slightly older version of Bluez currently used by Fedora 35. Any idea of how I can diagnose this? Not really a big deal as my new headset arrives Monday and I can put up with poor sound quality using my backup headset for a couple days.

                              <span>Anybody faced similar issues manually partitioning their install with this script+version? I have tried countless times to resolve &quot;bootctl --path&#x3D;/boot, install exit with code [256]: b&#x27;File system &quot;/boot&quot; is not a FAT EFI System Partition (ESP) file system.&quot;. I have partitioned and flagged my nvme drive either through this script (doesn&#x27;t flag), fdisk, gdisk, and gparted without a resolution. I have partitioned /boot with all the filesystem formats but same error. I&#x27;m certain the auto partitioning scheme works perfectly well however boot and root auot partitioned sizes are to small for my 1tb preferences. Anything I maybe missing or doing wrong is greatly appreciated!
 Perferred Scheme (Recreating Error)
 {nvme0n1p1 /boot 1GB EXT4 BOOT/EFI(ESP)}
 {nvme0n1p2 / 50GB XFS Linux FS} 
 {nvme0n1p3 /home 100% XFS Linux home}

                              <span>SetupDiag is a free Microsoft utility that can be very useful for diagnosing any problems you may encounter in Windows updates. It will save you a lot of time if you run this program before migrating your Windows to a higher version: its generated log files will tell you what can possibly go wrong. Also, if you run into an unsuccessful update, SetupDiag will detect the root cause of failure for you to take corrective measures.

                              <span>Hi, I was normally browsing Firefox when at some point some tabs stopped working randomly. I thought nothing of it and just closed firefox but then it would not start again, just as any other graphical app I try to open (Brave, VS Code and others). The error that firefox is giving me is:
 XPCOMGlueLoad error: error for file /usr/lib/firefox/libmozgtk.so libicuuc.so.71: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Couldn&#x27;t load XPCOM
 VS Code gives me this error:
 /opt/visual-studio-code/bin/../code: error while loading shared libraries: libicuuc.so.71: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
 So yeah, it looks like something screwed up the stuff needed for graphical interfaces, but I did nothing other than update my system (and I see no one else currently complaining about some similar breakage). What should I do?
 EDIT: updated my system after typing this post out, everything now works normally ¯_(ツ)_/¯

                              <span>I&#x27;ve written a little script that outputs something like this:
 ✅ dbus (package: 4 days ago, service: 4 days ago) 🚨 dendrite (package: 23 minutes ago, service: 3 days ago) ✅ polkit (package: 18 days ago, service: 3 days ago) 🚨 sshd (package: 28 minutes ago, service: 4 days ago) ✅ syncthing@tombh (package: 9 days ago, service: 4 days ago) 
 So basically comparing a package&#x27;s last upgrade time (from pacman.log) with its systemd last start time. Have I reinvented the wheel?
 The script itself if anybody&#x27;s interested:

                              <span>I just installed a fresh copy of Arch using archinstall. I selected cinnamon as the DE and it&#x27;s working fine, but I would like to try out a couple different DEs, so I installed LightDM. After installing cutefish, LightDM should now offer a selection between cinnamon and cutefish, right? Well, the greeter asks for the password and then boots straight into cinnamon.
 I read all the wiki pages and I still can&#x27;t get LightDM to offer the choice. I tried modifying the ~/.dmrc file and creating an ~/.xinitrc file, but they only work halfway. Some windows use cutefish, and others, like the taskbar and start menu use cinnamon. Can someone tell me what I&#x27;m missing here? Do I need to reinstall without a DE, install LightDM first, and then install any DEs/WMs?
 Here&#x27;s a screenshot with the files I&#x27;ve made/modified, and the mixed DEs. Sorry for being a noob https://imgur.com/a/2q30lQc

I wanna try install it on my freshly new PC with no operating system on it and wondered if there would be anything I should know ahead in terms of the partition and stuffs like that.

 How to fix?
 Not sure what to do since the file is still there so don&#x27;t know how to make it register again?

Arch
 Cinnamon with Xorg (i.e. not wayland)
 Nvidia GPU
 Steam/Proton To Launch Game
 Single Monitor
  
Using Proton 6.3.8, I can launch BfV and it works like normal (full screen). If I switch to Proton 7, the game launches fine but just stays minimised in the bottom panel, and whenever I click it, it opens for a split second and minimises again. I&#x27;ve tried running a /etc/env value of export SDL_VIDEO_MINIMIZE_ON_FOCUS_LOSS&#x3D;0. I&#x27;ve also tried using that variable in the launcher options for the game. If I run the game in 6.3.8 and change it to boarderless full screen, and then run the game in proton 7 it works (although, for whatever reason my menu bar keeps popping up every so often). I don&#x27;t understand what I actually need to check to try and work out what bit is causing the game to constantly minimise. Where to go from here?

 Can it do any harm to the system? (e.g. something like yay -Sy sway-git)
