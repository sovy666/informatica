                              <span>My friend told me that the wm is more effective than de and he suggested me to try it. But I have tried many wms like i3,dwm, awesomewm, and so on. However, I found it is too difficult to configure. I can&#x27;t understand why people promote it on effective and professional. I agree with the opinion that it is professional. But I really don&#x27;t understand why people call it is more effective.

                              <span>I am fairly new to the arch community. I didn&#x27;t really start using Arch (btw) until about 6 months ago. For context, I have used a great many distros, many of them debian based (ubuntu, mint, lubuntu), over the years. I got into Linux in the mid 2000s, after a computer failure left me without a hard drive and a friend showed me how to boot from a usb and I taught myself to install to USB, back when 4gb was an expensive(ish) buy for a usb drive. 
 I loved linux immediately, and although Ubuntu was my first distro, I hopped a lot, usually just multi booting, always with Windows too, just in case. I eventually became more comfortable with linux to the point I started running my own servers for small webhosting projects. I also found I liked using a linux desktop for php development as well.

                              <span>I have been scratching my head for this problem and can’t seem to figure it out. I have reinstalled arch multiple time but it always come back. 
 Issue:
 Issue can be easily spot in firefox while scrolling specially arch wiki (white background and lots of texts). 
 Glitches appears as horizontal bar and in that bar almost all fonts gets little bigger kind of thing so it feels like there is some kind of glass cylinder making some font little different and then other.
 In a full screen it is easy to spot as well.
 Troubleshoot:
  
 So far i have tried installation arch multiple time but I think all the packages I install are same except windows manager, first it was xmonad and now its qtile
  I have tried manjaro (kde, sway, xfce) all works fine.
  I have 20-intel.conf for TearFree and TrippleBuffer but no help. 
  Already uninstalled picom compositor.
  From arch wiki also disabled vsync as well but no help.
  
Hardware:
  
 i5-8250u
  UHD-620
  
Driver that i have right now:
  
 mesa
  xf86-video-intel
  vulkan-intel
  
Any help would be really good.

                              <span>Smartphones, for the most part, have opened up technology to seniors and the older generation — their intuitive and large touch-screens proving much friendlier to use than old mobile phones with buttons (or circle-dial phones).
    
When looking at the best smartphone for seniors, we took various criteria into account like screen brightness and size, special accessibility features, and modernity. Do your grandma and grandpa think an Android is the metal trashcan from “Lost In Space”? It’s time to take them under the arm and guide them into the modern age. The phones listed below should be enough to convince them that smartphone technology isn’t all that scary.

 What do I have to do to get this to work? I just installed it and I thought it should work, but it didn&#x27;t. When I was using ubuntu, it was able to be picked up by my bios. Arch is simply not there. The only way to boot into it is by going into a separate boot manager. Windows is first boot. I am running on an alienware aurora r11. Please help if you can.

                              <span>Guys,
 I know this is not easily measurable and it perhaps depends on the machine used but anyway...
 Has anybody else also experienced that Firefox feels a bit faster and snappier (lower latency) in the current GNOME 42/Wayland than in SwayWM? Frankly, I expected the opposite to be true because Sway feels so vanilla. So I expected less layers &#x3D;&gt; faster perfomance...

                              <span>The wiki says,
  
The default configuration files are ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf and ~/.gnupg/dirmngr.conf. 
 ... 
 You will find skeleton files in /usr/share/doc/gnupg/. These files are copied to ~/.gnupg the first time gpg is run if they do not exist there. Other examples are found in #See also.
  
But this is wrong. I&#x27;ve run gpg and I don&#x27;t have those files. Neither do I have the skeleton in the /usr/ directory. I do have the file /usr/share/doc/gnupg/examples/gpgconf.conf, but ironically this file clearly states at the beginning that,
  
# This is a legacy mechanism. The modern way is to use global 
 # configuration files like /etc/gnupg/gpg.conf which are more 
 # flexible and better integrated into the configuration system.
  
But, there is no /etc/gnupg/gpg.conf.
 #########################################################################
 The wiki also says that we should add public key servers to the file ~/.gnupg/dirmngr.conf. But at openpgp.org it says we should add the key servers to the file gpg.conf.
 #########################################################################
 There are a lot of contradictory statements here.
 How do we set this program up?

                              <span>Hey there, I successfully run Arch-Linux with KDE for a couple of years without any bigger problems. However, today I upgraded my system and since then KDE plasma (X11) is full of bugs. Tray icons of non-plasma programs didn&#x27;t show up, plasma-nm (even if it wasn&#x27;t updated) couldn&#x27;t connect to any openvpn connection (it worked with openvpn XY.conf via the terminal), opening a file from dolphin took ages and I couldn&#x27;t switch my keyboard layouts anymore from the panel nor my global shortcuts.
 I did checked the logs, but I couldn&#x27;t find any errors, I checked the arch bug tracker of all kde programs I&#x27;ve upgraded, but I couldn&#x27;t find any bug. I reset my panels and set them up again, but it didn&#x27;t change anything for me, I tired a wayland session, which did allow me to change the keyboard layout again, but didn&#x27;t solve any of the other problems.
 However, as I had to get back to work, I downgraded all my packages via the arch archive to 2022-05-12 (the time I ran the last time updates) and since then everything runs smooth.
 Here the list of packages I&#x27;ve upgraded today (and now downgraded): https://pastebin.com/GZq8AF2n
 Do you guys experience the same problems? Do you have an idea which programs cause the bugs, so we/I can make a helpful bug report?
 Cheers and thanks in advance.

 I have my old windows install on /dev/sdb which i want to replace with a fresh windows install.

 Will i run into any issues when dualbooting Arch in a btrfs filesystem and windows in ntfs?

                              <span>Hi guys, in principal it works but doesn&#x27;t.
 ThinkPad T460 Intel Core i5 6300 KDE on X11 Kernel: 5.15 
 I&#x27;ve got the drivers installed (libva-intel-driver), vainfo says it&#x27;s fine and I got it to work. I read the Arch wiki in all details.In Firefox with rdd sandbox deactivated it works well... until it didn&#x27;t while the video played. I don&#x27;t know why. Right now after reboot it works.
 Playback with mpv doesn&#x27;t work but it worked before. mpv.conf is set to activate vaapi but it worked without hassle before I set it there. Playing back with Haruna, which uses mpv, doesn&#x27;t use vaapi until I open settings and navigate to playback where I set it to vaapi, then it uses surprinsingly the hardware decode units. Maybe less than it should but I&#x27;m not sure about that.
 What the hell is going on? I get the Firefox thing, which will be hopefully resolved in the near future. But everything in all it works until it doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s so unstable.I could try it once more in Wayland but back then it didn&#x27;t.

                              <span>I am unsure if this belongs to /zfs or /archlinux, but lets give it a shot here.
 I updated my Arch on ZFS. On reboot, Grub complains that the vmlinuz image cant be found.
 After a reboot from an USB with my Arch stick (with zfs), I was able to import and mount the zpool. All my files in /home is there, and the rest of the Linux files too. But /boot is empty except for the grub files. No initrd or vmlinuz files to be found.
 # zpool list
 zroot 446G 51G 392G ...
 # mkdir /zzz
 There is two zfs filesystems, the root fs and a home fs. Both are shown when I do an zfs list
 zroot
 zroot/rootfs /zzz
 zroot/rootfs/home /zzz/home
 The disk also have an EFI partition, but it is not used for kernel images. The only files there are related to EFI itself.
 # zfs get mountpoint
 List of the root filesystem and all snapshots. Looks good including the snapshot I made before the (failed) update today.
 zfs mount -a
 # arch-chroot /zzz
 ls -l /boot
 NADA
 What now? Do I need to redo the (quite complex) linux+zfs installation, or is there some way to recover.

                              <span>Oh boy I hope I don&#x27;t get removed. I will try to keep it short. Look into gentoo installation guide, everything is elaborated. It explains everything in one page. I learned to install arch just via watching youtube videos and reading the gentoo wiki. The installation guide for example, does not explain on how to make new mount points. It simply touches on the command and link it to another page. An linux user using ubuntu, fedora, or anything similar will may have never learned how to make new folders. Arch Linux expects you to know that. If you don&#x27;t they simply link it to the main page of the particular command. One example is on gentoo wiki about the filesystems they elaborate a small para about the basics of the filesystem. Then they link it to the main page if you want to read more. You could install gentoo without the need to go to another page in the wiki. In arch wiki you need to go through atleast 10 different pages to be able to have a working system. The solution is they need to elaborate more on certain topics like what is EFI partition, certain commands.

                              <span>It’s not my will to bore you with my life, but I usually connect my laptop with Arch Linux to my iPhone on the train.
 The point is that I use iwctl to connect the laptop to the iPhone, but I need several tries to get a success connection. iwctl will return me operation failed several times until a success connection. In the iPhone before to fail it says there is a device connected.
 When I arrive at home and try the same command to my home’s wifi, it works perfectly.
 I don’t have multiple daemon or services of dhcp or nm ( I checked it could be the problem ).
 What would you propose to seek the solution? Here the things I thought:
  
Destroy the privative-software-based device iPhone and get a linux-based smartphone.
 Create a sh that retries until it’s connected. (Actually, I made it, but it’s dirty working that way)
 Install network manager (I did not, because I would like to work with iwctl, it is not laptop’s fault 😔)
  
Any idea or comment are welcome. I upvote, I’m not an asshole.

                              <span>As far as I know, when rust binaries are built their dependencies are downloaded and built into the executable. I&#x27;m a fan of having all binaries link to shared libraries instead, in order to be able to fix all instances of a given vulnerability with a single package upgrade instead of worrying about whether they have propagated to every dependent executable I use.
 In practice, does the package of a rust binary leave me open to vulnerabilities longer than a package that links to everything dynamically would? I would love to get some packagers&#x27; perspective on this as well. Do you see issues with this dependency handling approach? Your experience from other languages might also be relevant if they use the same model.
 EDIT: adding another question; those of you who do consider it a security concern, do you abstain from using programs written in rust or do you find the risk acceptable in order to use the apps you like?

 I need to buy another one. But AMD GPUs with similar specs are priced higher than NVIDIA ones where I live.
 I have never had any issue with driver though in my Arch Linux installation. But I always felt guilt about using NVIDIA (due to closed source) and planned to buy an AMD GPU as the next one, because of the open source.
 Is it justified at this moment to spend more to get an AMD GPU?

                              <span>Title. I need help getting it to work again.
 This is the output I get when I try to run it from the command line:
 blender: symbol lookup error: blender: undefined symbol: _ZNKSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEE7compareEPKc, version LLVM_13 
 I tried looking up that output online, but all I got was an unrelated issue relating to Alembic.
 Blender version: blender 17:3.1.2-2
 Edit: fixed after another update

                              <span>Ci sono persone che preferiscono utilizzare i programmi portable perché “sporcano” meno il sistema operativo, rispetto a un normale programma installato, inoltre sono più facili da eliminare perché, se non ci interessano più, basta cancellarli. Uno dei pochi svantaggi è che non vengono direttamente registrati tra i programmi utilizzabili per aprire un determinato tipo di file. In genere, il programma portable può avere le sue opzioni per poterlo fare, oppure possiamo noi cambiare manualmente questo tipo di associazione, ma grazie a Portable Registrator possiamo rendere più semplice questa associazione e registrare le applicazioni portable tra quelle utilizzabili.

                              <span>Almost everybody collects something. But keeping up with that collection isn’t always easy. You could just write it all down, but wouldn’t an app be easier? There are plenty of great apps just for collecting one type of thing. However, collection organizing apps are ideal for managing nearly any type of collection and even multiple collections in a single app.

                              <span>Having dash cam footage during an accident or capturing what happens to your car in a parking lot can save you a lot of time and headaches. Picking the perfect dash cam, though, isn’t always easy. The 70mai Dash Cam M500 is designed to make it easier to record your travels and monitor your car in parking lots. I recently had the opportunity take this dash cam for a test drive to test out its features.

Overview of Features
    
The 70mai Dash Cam M500 packs a lot of features into a small package. Unlike most dash cams that require a microSD card, this one has 64 GB of eMMC built-in storage. Not only does this type of storage usually last longer than your average SD card, but you don’t have to worry about a card being damaged and losing your footage.

                              <span>NVidia si starebbe preparando al lancio della nuova gamma di schede grafiche GeForce RTX 40: potrebbero essere presentate già a fine maggio in occasione del Computex 2022 per poi arrivare sul mercato a luglio prossimo.A quanto si apprende in via non ufficiale le RTX 40 saranno contraddistinte da un consumo energetico elevato che corrisponderà a un incisivo aumento di potenza: si parla di prestazioni addirittura raddoppiate, in alcuni casi, rispetto alle RTX 30.Le prime schede grafiche ad arrivare sul mercato saranno le RTX 4070, 4080 e 4090, con consumi di 300W, 400W e 600W.Una GeForce RTX 4090 utilizzerà una GPU AD102 realizzata sfruttando il processo costruttivo a 5 nm di TSMC e dovrebbe basare il suo funzionamento su qualcosa come 16.128 shader.Gli shader sarebbero supportati da un bus a 384 bit e memoria GDDR6 a 21 GHz per una larghezza di banda complessiva pari a 1 TB/s. Il TGP dovrebbe attestarsi sui 450W.Con la versione &#x27;Ti&#x27;, il chip grafico potrebbe essere quindi ancora più potente e spingersi fino a un massimo di 18.432 shader.</span>

                              <span>Molte delle stampanti oggi in commercio integrano il supporto di rete: sono capaci di collegarsi al router così come con qualunque sistema client, ricevono dal router stesso un indirizzo privato via DHCP. In alternativa, ed è il nostro consiglio, è possibile assegnare alla stampante un indirizzo IP locale statico.Le stampanti più moderne sono capaci di collegarsi al router via cavo Ethernet oppure utilizzando una connessione WiFi.Se si parla di un dispositivo che offre supporto Ethernet/WiFi, condividere stampante in rete è molto semplice anche se qualche imprevisto può sempre essere in agguato.
Condividere una stampante con supporto di rete
 Le stampanti con supporto di rete sono in assoluto le più semplici e immediate da configurarsi.Di solito è sufficiente collegare la stampante al router con il cavo di rete o via WiFi.</span>

                              <span>AU Optronics (AUO) è uno dei principali produttori al mondo di pannelli per monitor e display di tutti i tipi. L&#x27;azienda, con sede centrale a Taiwan, è all&#x27;avanguardia per ciò che riguarda la presentazione di prodotti capaci di offrire frequenze di refresh elevate.La novità più recente consiste nella presentazione di una coppia di pannelli con risoluzione FullHD, refresh a 480 Hz e tempo di risposta inferiore al millisecondo.Si tratta di prodotti che andranno a sostituire gli attuali pannelli a 360 Hz presenti in molti portatili e monitor di fascia alta destinati ai videogiocatori che possono disporre di budget importanti.L&#x27;unico aspetto negativo per ciò che riguarda la nuova proposta di AU Optronics, è che si tratta di pannelli in tecnologia TN: da più parti si solleva quindi qualche dubbio sulla fedeltà cromatica.In un altro articolo abbiamo visto come scegliere il monitor del PC e descritto le differenze tra pannelli TN, IPS e VA.In ogni caso, AU Optronics fa segnare un record perché quelli presentati sono i primi dispositivi FullHD al mondo a raggiungere una frequenza di refresh di 480 Hz.Sebbene i portavoce di AU Optronics non si siano sbilanciati sulla data di disponibilità, diverse fonti confermano che i pannelli per i display a 480 Hz potrebbero cominciare a essere prodotti già durante quest&#x27;anno.Il video pubblicato a questo indirizzo mostra molti altri pannelli AU Optronics: tra di essi vi sono un IPS UHD a 165 Hz, diversi modelli per i sistemi di infotainment delle auto e gli AmLED, un tipo di mini LED..</span>

                              <span>Se si ha la necessità di accedere a un PC Windows o a un sistema macOS pur non conoscendo la password per il login, Kon Boot è una delle soluzioni che si sono storicamente rivelate più affidabili.Kon Boot nasce nel 2008 e con il tempo ha subìto molteplici aggiornamenti adattandosi alla continua evoluzione della tecnologia.La differenza rispetto ad altre soluzioni per superare il login di Windows e bypassare l&#x27;inserimento della password, anche sulle macchine basate su macOS, è che Kon Boot inietta il suo codice in memoria prima del caricamento del sistema operativo.Questa tattica permette a Kon Boot di modificare temporaneamente il comportamento del sistema di autenticazione utilizzato da Windows e macOS permettendo il semplice superamento della password.Kon Boot non modifica la configurazione di Windows e di macOS né cambia le password degli account già presenti: il suo comportamento è assimilabile a quello di un bootkit benigno.A meno che l&#x27;utente non confermi a Kon Boot la volontà di creare un nuovo account amministratore, dopo il caricamento del programma è sufficiente accedere con qualunque utente digitando una password casuale e premendo Invio.Kon Boot va installato in una chiavetta USB (lo sviluppatore consiglia l&#x27;utilizzo di un&#x27;unità da almeno 16 GB di capienza) e il supporto viene automaticamente reso avviabile: lasciando inserita la chiavetta ed effettuando il boot da tale supporto, il programma disporrà il caricamento del codice per la &#x27;neutralizzazione&#x27; della procedura di autenticazione del sistema operativo.Per ripristinare la situazione precedente, a login effettuato basta semplicemente rimuovere la chiavetta con Kon Boot quindi spegnere la macchina oppure riavviarla.Kon Boot è assolutamente sicuro ma alcuni antimalware tendono a segnalarlo come una minaccia: ciò non deriva dal fatto che il programma contiene codice malevolo ma è semplicemente legato alla natura dell&#x27;utilità.</span>

(i am early loading the modules). this all started occuring after install gdm-plymouth and plymouth-git. both of which have since been removed

                              <span>Hello, this is an odd problem I&#x27;m having with using screenshot programs. 
 When I take a screenshot, if the region is too large (for instance, my entire 4k screen), I&#x27;m unable to copy it to &quot;web-based&quot; applications. Discord, web-browser (vivaldi), and element-desktop, are all the ones I&#x27;ve tested it with. They all do the same thing, just empty files or empty screenshots with a 0B size. If I do a smaller selection (like a 800x600 region), then I&#x27;m able to copy from my clipboard just fine.
 Weirdly though, I&#x27;m able to copy images from online just fine, some well past 16k resolution. Also, when using the screenshot programs, only those &quot;web-based&quot; applications are affected, I can copy into Krita and GIMP just fine, and if I copy from there, I can then copy it into those &quot;web-based&quot; applications just fine. I&#x27;m also able to copy large images from files just fine as well.
 I&#x27;ve tried this with flameshot, shutter, spectacle, and they all do the same thing. 
 I&#x27;m running a fresh install of arch with just i3-gaps + KDE, X11, no compositor (tried picom and that didn&#x27;t fix it, so I removed it).
 Any ideas? Anyone else had this issue and resolved it? Thanks.

                              <span>last week i announced efly, a new arch-based live medium for installing arch linux - or for using as a portable linux live system. however, some changes still needed to be made to make the system fully usable. you can now download ready-made boot images from the github page.
 instructions on how to build it yourself are provided on github. otherwise you can try it out directly:
  sudo pacman -S archiso wget https://github.com/flying-dude/efly/releases/download/latest/efly-live.iso run_archiso -i efly-live.iso 
 if you have plugged in a USB stick with corresponding device node /dev/sdY, then you can turn it into a bootable live medium like this (and yes, you can literally just copy an image to a block device and it&#x27;ll work):
  sudo cp efly-live.iso /dev/sdY 
 i also placed a modified version of the qemu wrapper in the repo, since i needed an option to mount virtfs file systems. here is an example from the help page:
  Share a folder with qemu: $ run_archiso_efly archiso-2020.05.23-x86_64.iso -- -virtfs local,path&#x3D;/path/to/share,mount_tag&#x3D;host0,security_model&#x3D;passthrough,id&#x3D;host0 Mount shared folder inside qemu: $ mkdir virtfs; sudo mount -t 9p -o trans&#x3D;virtio host0 virtfs/ 
 changelog:
  
browser: konqueror -&gt; chromium
 drop into tty when losing X server
 modified the prompt style of fish shell: 
 example showing prompt when in folder /usr/local/bin:
 old style: efly@arch /u/l/bin&gt;
 new style: [efly@arch] bin/ $

                              <span>Libstdc++ seems to have moved std::size_t and std::nullptr_t into the cstddef header as size_t and nullptr_t. I changed my code but it looks like other standard headers (type_traits for me) still use the old style and as such I&#x27;m getting a slew of build errors. Just wondering if anyone else is seeing this?

                              <span>Hello,
 I have absolutely no knowledge about linux or secure boot or whatever but I want to dual boot arch and windows.
 However, secure boot is blocking the boot of arch linux and I don&#x27;t want to disable secure boot since it leaves my PC vulnerable.
 I wanted to ask on how I can add my own signatures and keys to secure boot so I can boot up arch linux with secure boot being enabled.
 I kind of looked through the secure boot section and there was an append option which lets me add my own certificates and stuff, if that helps.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;ve just upgraded my system (which pulled in a bunch of new KDE package versions) and after restarting, Akonadi and everything using it, e.g. Kmail, don&#x27;t work anymore.
 akonadictl start produces the following output:
 org.kde.pim.akonadictl: Starting Akonadi Server... org.kde.pim.akonadictl: done. Connecting to deprecated signal QDBusConnectionInterface::serviceOwnerChanged(QString,QString,QString) org.kde.pim.akonadiserver: Starting up the Akonadi Server... akonadi.collectionattributetable OK akonadi.collectionmimetyperelation OK akonadi.collectionpimitemrelation OK /usr/bin/mysqlcheck: Got error: 2013: Lost connection to server during query when executing &#x27;CHECK TABLE ...

 Has anyone encountered similar issues? Any ideas what to do in order to fix this? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m not entirely sure how to describe this issue in a way a search engine would understand, and I haven&#x27;t done enough troubleshooting to ask the forums without getting someone annoyed at me, so I&#x27;m posting here to ask if anyone else has had the same issue as me:
 I just build a new pc with a modern graphics card, but my second monitor is attempting to display a screen larger than itself. It&#x27;s displaying the correct resolution, but seems to think the screen size itself is an inch larger than it actually is, so my mouse and my windows can go about a cm or so offscreen at any given edge. It&#x27;s really annoying, as maximizing applications will prevent me from seeing their borders. It also looks really ugly, as despite the monitor displaying the correct resolution internally, it&#x27;s actually displaying a weird, large fraction of the 1440p that it&#x27;s supposed to (since the borders are cut off) and it looks downscaled.
 This issue did not occur with my previous computer, and my primary monitor is working perfectly fine. Both monitors are 2560x1440. This issue persisted all the way from initial install from the bootable medium, through installation of KDE.
 Possible causes I&#x27;ve thought of:
  
I&#x27;m using an HDMI cable instead of a DisplayPort cable (I don&#x27;t have the spare cable to test this, though)
 The monitor is too old for it to report its size to my GPU properly, so it&#x27;s receiving an incorrect size.
  
Does anyone have any help or suggestions for troubleshooting?

After a lot of opposition, Verizon eventually stopped supporting AppFlash and disabled it  on existing devices through updates (whereas newer devices don’t come with it preinstalled). Yep, it’s all been a bit messy, so here’s everything you need to know.
