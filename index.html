(i am early loading the modules). this all started occuring after install gdm-plymouth and plymouth-git. both of which have since been removed

 I&#x27;m not sure where to start trying to solve this problem. After closing the game and opening it again performance is fine again.
 Any help is appreciated. I didn&#x27;t see the service spit out any errors, but it&#x27;s possible I don&#x27;t know where to look.

                              <span>Hello, this is an odd problem I&#x27;m having with using screenshot programs. 
 When I take a screenshot, if the region is too large (for instance, my entire 4k screen), I&#x27;m unable to copy it to &quot;web-based&quot; applications. Discord, web-browser (vivaldi), and element-desktop, are all the ones I&#x27;ve tested it with. They all do the same thing, just empty files or empty screenshots with a 0B size. If I do a smaller selection (like a 800x600 region), then I&#x27;m able to copy from my clipboard just fine.
 Weirdly though, I&#x27;m able to copy images from online just fine, some well past 16k resolution. Also, when using the screenshot programs, only those &quot;web-based&quot; applications are affected, I can copy into Krita and GIMP just fine, and if I copy from there, I can then copy it into those &quot;web-based&quot; applications just fine. I&#x27;m also able to copy large images from files just fine as well.
 I&#x27;ve tried this with flameshot, shutter, spectacle, and they all do the same thing. 
 I&#x27;m running a fresh install of arch with just i3-gaps + KDE, X11, no compositor (tried picom and that didn&#x27;t fix it, so I removed it).
 Any ideas? Anyone else had this issue and resolved it? Thanks.

                              <span>According to this, there&#x27;s no supported firmware for the BCM4364 card. Does this mean I have no hope of using Arch without an ethernet cable? Is there any way to revert back to MacOS and take the firmware from there?

                              <span>last week i announced efly, a new arch-based live medium for installing arch linux - or for using as a portable linux live system. however, some changes still needed to be made to make the system fully usable. you can now download ready-made boot images from the github page.
 instructions on how to build it yourself are provided on github. otherwise you can try it out directly:
  sudo pacman -S archiso wget https://github.com/flying-dude/efly/releases/download/latest/efly-live.iso run_archiso -i efly-live.iso 
 if you have plugged in a USB stick with corresponding device node /dev/sdY, then you can turn it into a bootable live medium like this (and yes, you can literally just copy an image to a block device and it&#x27;ll work):
  sudo cp efly-live.iso /dev/sdY 
 i also placed a modified version of the qemu wrapper in the repo, since i needed an option to mount virtfs file systems. here is an example from the help page:
  Share a folder with qemu: $ run_archiso_efly archiso-2020.05.23-x86_64.iso -- -virtfs local,path&#x3D;/path/to/share,mount_tag&#x3D;host0,security_model&#x3D;passthrough,id&#x3D;host0 Mount shared folder inside qemu: $ mkdir virtfs; sudo mount -t 9p -o trans&#x3D;virtio host0 virtfs/ 
 changelog:
  
browser: konqueror -&gt; chromium
 drop into tty when losing X server
 modified the prompt style of fish shell: 
 example showing prompt when in folder /usr/local/bin:
 old style: efly@arch /u/l/bin&gt;
 new style: [efly@arch] bin/ $

                              <span>Libstdc++ seems to have moved std::size_t and std::nullptr_t into the cstddef header as size_t and nullptr_t. I changed my code but it looks like other standard headers (type_traits for me) still use the old style and as such I&#x27;m getting a slew of build errors. Just wondering if anyone else is seeing this?

                              <span>Hello,
 I have absolutely no knowledge about linux or secure boot or whatever but I want to dual boot arch and windows.
 However, secure boot is blocking the boot of arch linux and I don&#x27;t want to disable secure boot since it leaves my PC vulnerable.
 I wanted to ask on how I can add my own signatures and keys to secure boot so I can boot up arch linux with secure boot being enabled.
 I kind of looked through the secure boot section and there was an append option which lets me add my own certificates and stuff, if that helps.
 Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not entirely sure how to describe this issue in a way a search engine would understand, and I haven&#x27;t done enough troubleshooting to ask the forums without getting someone annoyed at me, so I&#x27;m posting here to ask if anyone else has had the same issue as me:
 I just build a new pc with a modern graphics card, but my second monitor is attempting to display a screen larger than itself. It&#x27;s displaying the correct resolution, but seems to think the screen size itself is an inch larger than it actually is, so my mouse and my windows can go about a cm or so offscreen at any given edge. It&#x27;s really annoying, as maximizing applications will prevent me from seeing their borders. It also looks really ugly, as despite the monitor displaying the correct resolution internally, it&#x27;s actually displaying a weird, large fraction of the 1440p that it&#x27;s supposed to (since the borders are cut off) and it looks downscaled.
 This issue did not occur with my previous computer, and my primary monitor is working perfectly fine. Both monitors are 2560x1440. This issue persisted all the way from initial install from the bootable medium, through installation of KDE.
 Possible causes I&#x27;ve thought of:
  
I&#x27;m using an HDMI cable instead of a DisplayPort cable (I don&#x27;t have the spare cable to test this, though)
 The monitor is too old for it to report its size to my GPU properly, so it&#x27;s receiving an incorrect size.
  
Does anyone have any help or suggestions for troubleshooting?

                              <span>I have been running a dynamic VFIO GPU passthrough setup for a windows VM for over a year now. I have a 3080 which I use for both passthrough and CUDA compute (when the VM isn&#x27;t being used), with a 980 as my primary linux display. This configuration is similar to the &quot;Single GPU Passthrough&quot; guides (Link to guide), where the target GPU is dynamically unbound from the nvidia driver and rebound to the vfio driver. This setup has been working great until the most recent nvidia driver 515.43. Prior to the update, the nvidia modules could be dynamically unbound (after killing all processes which use the GPU, such as sddm.service and then verifying by running nvidia-smi) using the following commands (and I believe this order mattered):
 ## Load the config file source &quot;/etc/libvirt/hooks/kvm.conf&quot; ## Kill KDE systemctl stop sddm.service #Unbind VTconsoles echo 0 &gt; /sys/class/vtconsole/vtcon0/bind echo 0 &gt; /sys/class/vtconsole/vtcon1/bind # Unbind EFI-framebuffer echo efi-framebuffer.0 &gt; /sys/bus/platform/drivers/efi-framebuffer/unbind # Avoid race condition sleep 3 # Unload Nvidia modprobe -r nvidia_drm modprobe -r nvidia_modeset modprobe -r drm_kms_helper modprobe -r nvidia modprobe -r i2c_nvidia_gpu modprobe -r drm modprobe -r nvidia_uvm 
 After the update, I am unable to dynamically unbind these modules as they report that the module is still in use and cannot be unbound (essentially running the above commands as su). I am assuming this is an issue with the NVIDIA driver but it could also be the linux kernel (5.17.7-arch1-1) issue as they both were updated at the same time.
 Is anyone else having this problem? For now I have just reverted to a non-dynamic setup where VFIO takes the card at boot, but it looks like those using single GPU passthrough may have issues until this is fixed.

                              <span>I am trying to hardware acceleration working with Firefox, but my Nvidia GPU is causing me trouble (yes, I know I should have bought and AMD card, but I did not use Linux back then). So I followed the guide on ArchWiki, but Firefox will not start when LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME&#x3D;nvidia is set. I also tried setting the environment variable MOZ_DISABLE_RDD_SANDBOX&#x3D;1, but without success. However, Firefox works if I set VDPAU_DRIVER&#x3D;nvidia and LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME&#x3D;nouveau, but this does not solve the high CPU usage. Did I miss something? Below I posted some relevant information. Let me know if you need anything else.

 I&#x27;m wondering if anyone made the decision to switch from Manjaro to Arch for their daily driver, and what was the main reason for the switch. It seems that the two distros have a lot in common, so that there wouldn&#x27;t be enough pressure to make the switch unless there were some good reasons. Yet, many here are former Manjaro users. What prompted y&#x27;all to change?

                              <span>I did a sudo pacman -Syu as I usually do and pacman was telling me nvidia-dkms and nvidia are in conflict and wants to remove nvidia. I have both because I use dkms for hardened and regular nvidia for the regular Arch kernel. I know I could blacklist the nvidia package in pacman but then it wouldn&#x27;t get updates. Should I be using dkms on the regular Arch kernel as well? Anyone run into this situation before? Thx Archerbros

                              <span>Device carriers and manufacturers have never quite understood users – we don’t like or need bloatware. Yet, Verizon decided all Android users needed AppFlash on their devices. It quietly appeared on existing devices in 2017 and later became preinstalled. 
    
After a lot of opposition, Verizon eventually stopped supporting AppFlash and disabled it  on existing devices through updates (whereas newer devices don’t come with it preinstalled). Yep, it’s all been a bit messy, so here’s everything you need to know.

                              <span>My system has been updating just fine for months daily. Starting about 2 days ago when ever I try to pacman -Syu or yay, I get that warning and it wants to remove nvidia from the target list because it conflicts with nvidia-dkms.
 I use the regular Linux kernel and have had nvidia installed for months. Choosing not to remove nvidia stops the update. I don&#x27;t remember installing nvidia-dkms. I do have steam installed and use proton often as well as lutris occasionally. So im not sure if a long time ago I followed a tutorial for dependencys and installed nvidia-dkms, but regardless the system has been running fine and still is. 
 Just worried If I select to remove nvidia it&#x27;ll mess up my graphics driver.

                              <span>I had an issue with sound and videos after a recent update
 For some reason the sound worked on system startup, I could change the volume and hear the volume change sound. However when I tried playing an mp3 or a video online it had no sound. Even the volume change sound would be gone at this point. Most videos on the internet would not play, the youtube player threw an error. but some soundless videos did manage to play on reddit
 It was the same for both Gnome and KDE. I also tried checking if the device was suddenly getting muted on alsamixer or pavucontrol, but no
 In the end I noticed the wiki had added pipewire as an alternative to pulseaudio and installing that while removing pulseaudio managed to fix all the issues 
 Did anyone else face something similar?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to region up an sshfs mount through fstab but no matter what I do it seems to require me to run mount -a manually after I log in. At a ⠀guess, it seems that it&#x27;s failing due to not having a network before trying to mount (I have the _netdev option set on the line in fstab which I thought should prevent that) and I&#x27;m not really sure what to do about it at this point. Here&#x27;s the full line from fstab: arembrandt@192.168.1.128:/homes/media /media/plex fuse.sshfs _netdev,identityfile&#x3D;/home/arembrandt/.ssh/id_rsa,defaults 0 0 My best guess is that the issue os because this device is on wifi and NetworkManager doesn&#x27;t start before things get mounted, but I can&#x27;t seem to find how I would fix that or even a way to confirm that that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>I finished the Arch Installation process, at first I was using Manjaro, then I tried out the newly updated archinstall and once I was done and booted, I decided to redo the installation but this time the traditional way. Took me about 6 hours, I was installing it on a laptop and was stuck with network configuration for a while, but once that was done the rest was relatively alright with some errors along the way. 
 Getting the systemd bootloader to run was also a bit of a pain but after I booted into Arch tty proper, just installed KDE and Xorg, Wayland and rebooted. Then I installed firefox, yay (which also was giving me errors because my mirror database was outdated already) and then I installed a GUI Pamac installer for convenience sake. I&#x27;m going to set things up more now but I&#x27;m pretty much well up and running, am pretty proud of myself rn. I can say &quot;btw I use arch&quot; no shame now :D

 Like how you use torrent pieces but on arch mirrors.

                              <span>In general, would using SW RAID 1 (mdadm) on 2 fast NVME disks give even faster random/sequential read speeds? OS can simultaneously multiplex between the disks to satisfy read requests.
 Is that correct?
 Comment. I&#x27;ve done some benchmarks, and the results are almost the same in both scenarios. Benchmarking I/O is tricky though, so asking for a more general point of view.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve recently found out that steam installed from flatpak on my machine runs games at abysmal performance (~1 FPS). A couple of weeks ago it was working fine, but I can&#x27;t pinpoint exactly when the issue appeared as I haven&#x27;t gamed for a few days.
 Steam installed natively from the repos, on the other hand, works just fine. Everything runs at the expected speed. Also desktop performance is perfectly normal.
 Has something happened recently regarding flatpaks?
 I have an nvidia gtx 1070, in case it&#x27;s an nvidia issue.

 What prompted me to think about permissions/ownership was this comment in the Arch Linux forums where it was recommended that a script run by a pacman hook be stored in /usr/local/bin presumably because it is not writable by regular user and only by root. It is implied that the concern is that regular user (not necessarily literally a person, could be malicious/buggy code running as your user) could write to the script if it were in ~/bin and that would be executable by root since one pacman is often run with root permissions and pacman hooks will execute scripts with those permissions.

However, Steam doesn’t offer any information about how to find your Steam ID (it’s not the same thing as your username and profile name), so here we show you a couple of ways to do it and how you can change it to something more personal and memorable.
