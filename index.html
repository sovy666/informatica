                              <span>Hi all! I&#x27;ve been trying to install Arch, but I&#x27;m having issues with it.
 During installation the Live OS will freeze. Using Arch itself, a GUI installer, and other Arch based distros. I did get an Arch based distro to install, but it freezes also minutes after booting. I would rather use vanilla Arch instead of a distro anyways. I&#x27;ve used Linux before, and even got my Linux+ certification in 2011. I haven&#x27;t used Linux in a while and want to play around again.
 I want to use Arch since it&#x27;s what SteamOS is based on, but I don&#x27;t want to use SteamOS.
 My hardware is as follows Ryzen 5 3600x ASRock Fatal1ty B450 Gaming-ITX/ac 32GB crucial 3200 ram AMD Radeon 5700xt
 I&#x27;ve tried searching and using different commands but either I&#x27;m doing it wrong or it&#x27;s not working for me.
 Thank you for your time!

                              <span>Arch is supposed to bundle all development files in with the standard packages, yet it seems like half of the packages only include the headers, and no actual source files.
 Specifically, I&#x27;m trying to compile something using libsensors. /usr/include/sensors/sensors.h exists, but the linker is throwing a fit because the equivalent sensors.c file is nowhere to be found when searching in /usr.
 Am I missing something here? Why are these files not included in the packages?

My issue magically resolved itself with my latest update. So if you have been having issues with waking from sleep maybe updating will get it working for you again.
 P.S. Any tips to troubleshoot this in the future would be cool, I never got it figured as powering off just worked.

                              <span>I was wondering which drive should I install Arch on; nvme0n1 which is 223.6G or sda which is my hard drive which is 931.5G. (I&#x27;m a newbie so I don&#x27;t know that much :D).

                              <span>So I want to install arch on my main BIOS machine and would like to avoid the archinstall.
 The only problem I got up until now is to find the BEST partition method for my system. I could go easy and simple and just repeat whatever guide or tutorial out there in Youtube like I&#x27;ve done so far but I really find myself in the need of step up.
 I know this depends on lots of factors and I would like some guidance.
 Some of my questions:
 should I go with btrfs or xfs? 
 why some partitions require one filesystem or another?
 should I allocate the swap at the beginning or at the end?
 ​
 Right now my tab looks like this:
 sda1 - ext4 - 8M
 sda2 - swap - 8G
 sda3 - xfs - 100G (root)
 sda4 - btrfs - 580G (home)
 ​
 Any help would be much appreciated

 I&#x27;ve been using gnome-sound-recorder but I want to switch to something less bloat. I guess ffmpeg might help but I&#x27;m not sure if I could get a good audio quality using only ffmpeg.
 I use this command in my script to record my screen along with my voice but my voice is not usually recorded properly. For example, my last words [at the end of the recording] usually are cut off and I don&#x27;t know why.
 ffmpeg -video_size ${SCREEN_WIDTH}x${SCREEN_HEIGHT} -framerate 16 -f x11grab -i :0.0 -f pulse -ac 2 -i default ~/Videos/$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%T).mp4

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m a newbie to Arch and Linux in general so please excuse me if my knowledge is a little bit underwhelming. I was wondering how to properly set up WiFi on Arch. I already know how to use IWCTL and how to connect to WiFi but is there anything else needed for a working WiFi so it connects when I boot and is there anything to set up with NetworkManager. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have access to ethernet so using that and going the easy route is out of the picture. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I had installed wine earlier, and I uninstalled it. I uninstalled all dependencies along with it.
 pacman -Qdtq and pacman -Qdttq do not list lib32-attr, and lib32-libogg. (These commands list nothing)
 pacman -Qe does not list it either.
 When I try to uninstall them, they give no error or warning.
 They are not an explicitly installed package. Neither a normal or an optional dependency.
 Why are they still installed?

Any clue as to what is going on?

 This is the screen I get now. https://ibb.co/s9Szc5r
 At first, it wasn&#x27;t recognizing the kernel images that I had installed. I removed and reinstalled my kernels as well as my boot manager-refind-and that changed it to what you see now.
 The bootmanager pulls up fine. The normal options are all there. I can load into recovery media perfectly fine and see that everything is still there just the way it was before it stopped booting. It just won&#x27;t boot into arch.
 It appears that, for some reason, the system cannot locate the file systems.
 Please help.

                              <span>The title explains it all, i&#x27;m an Arch user, and I have it installed in my Desktop PC. I do trust my family members and I&#x27;m literally the only person who would ever have physical access to it. My question here is: Is it worth encrypting the disk in my case ? Cause I have to backup all my data + dotfiles before doing a clean install of Arch.
 Thanks in advance! I&#x27;m all ears to hear out ur opinions.

                              <span>Hello,I&#x27;m trying to install video drivers for my system. I&#x27;m running arch off of a USB onto a Dell G15 laptop. It has a NVIDIA 3060 GPU and I think it has integrated Intel graphics. To log into my system I just use tty1 and then start X on login. I use i3.
 I&#x27;ve tried installing the NVIDIA package a couple times but it always leads to some sort of issue where my system completely stalls whenever I start X. Because of this, I&#x27;m pretty sure some sort of configuration is wrong, but it could be that I&#x27;m installing the wrong driver or even something else entirely.
 I&#x27;d be fine with only using the integrated Intel graphics, but for some reason, xrandr doesn&#x27;t recognize my 2 external monitors that I connect via usbc dock.
 I&#x27;ve read through a a bunch of the wiki and done a decent amount of googling. Its entirely possible that I&#x27;ve missed something though. Any pointers in the right direction would be really really helpful. 
 Edit: I know the title says Audio and video, but I&#x27;ve decided to work on things one at a time haha.

                              <span>Hi, today I discovered an issue on my Arch. I rarely watch videos on my laptop, so I am not sure since when this issue has been there.
 When I try to play a video, the video just freeze. I can seek the bar on the player, but it will only change the frame shown. The video will keep freezing.
 Not only on Reddit, but on youtube as well.
 You can see the issue in action here: https://i.imgur.com/XbSlmfv.mp4
 Hopefully someone can give me an idea to try. Thanks!
  
Os: Arch
 kernel: linux 5.18.1.arch1-1
 Browser: Occur on Firefox and Chrome
 GPU: Occur on both AMDGPU and Nvidia

 The full command:

 Is there any way to make Arch ignore signatures, or some other way to work around this problem?

                              <span>So, basically, I&#x27;ve had two issues with Ubuntu so far that are enough to annoy me off the platform, so I&#x27;m looking at other options. I&#x27;m not intimidated at all by the Arch installation process because it&#x27;s literally just a set of instructions. 
 What I am concerned with is maintaining the machine. By that, I mean the following:
  
When I want to download something for &quot;Linux,&quot; Ubuntu is always listed at the top. It&#x27;s very easy. I sudo apt install or whatever else, and boom, I&#x27;ve got the program up and running. Is it equally easy to get software on Arch? Is there any branch of software at all (gaming, etc.) that will be even mildly annoying to get compared to Ubuntu?
 Will drivers work out of the gate or is that something that will need to be setup manually? I can list my specs if necessary, but that seems a bit presumptuous of me. The short version is: can I expect that if my machine/peripherals all run on Ubuntu, that they&#x27;ll run on Arch?
 Is maintaining/updating my system easy? I straight up don&#x27;t have to think about it on Ubuntu. I hit apt update, then sudo apt upgrade and I&#x27;m good to go.
  
Basically: the following scenario:
 I want to grab Lutris. Then I want to install League of Legends. After that, I want to get Rust setup. Then get Nitrogen for my wallpapers. Get Discord. Then, after leaving my computer up for a week like an idiot, I want to completely update my system (drivers, apps, git, whatever). Any chances for drivers/apps to brick because the latest update isn&#x27;t good?
 Is any part of that more complicated than Ubuntu?
 Is there any part of the daily driving experience that will be more annoying on Arch or is everything post-installation streamlined and easy?

 Following this post I have verified that they key exists in /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/org.gnome.desktop.privacy.gschema.xml, and I ran sudo glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas. But gnome still crashes with the same error, and when I run gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.privacy sure enough there&#x27;s no privacy-screen. I&#x27;m not familiar with gsettings, so I&#x27;d really appreciate any help.
 SOLVED: apparently there was something overwriting my XDG_DATA_DIRS so it was using different schemas

 Today, I installed the Arch with the latest ISO and, on the first boot, noticed I didn&#x27;t have any sound whatsoever. I was able to get the audio output working by creating the /etc/modprobe.d/dsp.conf file and appending options snd_intel_dspcfg dsp_driver&#x3D;1. Even so, the microphone is not detected. All I get in both alsamixer and pavucontrol is a monitor device, but not the micro.
 Also, my Bluetooth device isn&#x27;t working. I installed bluez and even bluez-hid2hci, but the device is not detected. If I run bluetoothctl power on, I get the message No default controller available.
 The Bluetooth device does appear in dmesg logs:

                              <span>I&#x27;m preparing a new Linux install on a Lenovo X1 Fold with a i5-L16G7 CPU: it&#x27;s essentially a mobile 10th generation Ice Lake core without AVX512 called Sunny Cove.
 My goal is a Wayland install, mostly for the foot terminal: I want to do terminal things with a wireless keyboard outside Msys2/Windows Terminal. I also want to try how touchscreen stuff works on Gnome.
 I started by reading a bit about what to do as the X1 Fold (with a weird CPU, OLED touchscreen no physical mouse or keyboard...) is a bit exotic. This may have caused a few issues in Ubuntu 22.04, like no backlight control, i915 not being able to claim the display in lshw -C video...
 Still, it&#x27;s such a cool device I still want to try to make it work on Linux.
 I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different kernel cmdline flags. They helped a bit for various things, but while waiting for my custom kernel to compile I&#x27;ve decided a best use of my time would be to try returning to Arch to do things the right way from the start!
 I found this post from libcg (account now deleted) which is very interesting given my i915 problems: https://web.archive.org/web/20160714232204/https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/4cojj9/it_is_probably_time_to_ditch_xf86videointel/
 In practice, on a new install for a 10th gen Ice Lake, would you chose to use modesetting over Intel driver? Even on Wayland?
 I understand you must still use drm+i915, but what else should I keep or install for video acceleration say on youtube?

                              <span>Hello, trying to do &quot;sudo pacman -Syu&quot; on my desktop running arch returned :

 ​
 After searching around for a solution, what worked was either removing the  files from /var/lib/pacman/sync or deleting the sync folder and letting it regenerate WITHOUT the .sig files by running pacman -Syu.
 However, editing de Siglevel to Required (removing the DatabaseOptional option), this no longer works. For this reason and from the research I had done, I was worried this solution leaves my system vulnerable so I decided to check if the arch install on my laptop, which was pretty much a fresh install only a couple of weeks old, had those .sig files.
 To my surprise, not only were those files missing, but I got the exact same error from &quot;sudo pacman -Syu&quot; as I did on my desktop, despite the fact that removing those same files on the desktop had been the solution there.
 Could anyone help me make sense of this, and help me fix the issue without leaving my systems vulnerable? Thank you very much

                              <span>At some point in May, the Plexamp Appimage stopped working entirely. Checking Plexamp&#x27;s logs, it says:
 [Javascript] INFO - Auth: Requesting PIN. [0x0513ba40] DEBUG - Networking: Create request 2: (POST https://plex.tv/api/v2/pins?strong&#x3D;true). [0xf61fb640] DEBUG - Networking: Completed request 2: (POST https://plex.tv/api/v2/pins?strong&#x3D;true) with code -59 (have 0 bytes) in 146 ms. [Javascript] ERROR - Auth: Could not get PIN HTTP status -59 
 cURL&#x27;s manual states code 59 means it cannot use the selected SSL cipher (whatever that may be). 
 The Plexamp Appimage doesn&#x27;t seem to be at fault as it hadn&#x27;t been updated before it broke and it works without issue on an xUbuntu 21.10 machine I have. Additionally, although I&#x27;m running Arch, I grabbed the latest Manjaro daily build as well as a build from April and threw them into a VM for testing. Plexamp had no issues with the build from April but the daily build exhibited the same behavior as Arch, cURL code -59.
 Worth noting the Flatpak version of Plexamp works as expected, but Plexamp by default doesn&#x27;t have a titlebar and I only had success force enabling it with the Appimage version.
 Tried downgrading OpenSSL and cURL but had no luck. I&#x27;m not sure where to go from here, especially since I thought Appimages contained all the required dependencies and wouldn&#x27;t rely on system packages. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

                              <span>GitHub programmers often add screenshots or animated GIFs to their repository pull requests. These techniques are definitely more eye-catching than making someone read several lines of plain text. Adding static screenshots is helpful if you want to insert visual changes or photographs inline. To demonstrate process flows and mouse-cursor motion, you can use MP4 videos and GIF animation. The following tutorial shows you how to add screenshots and MP4/GIF animation in GitHub pull requests.

                              <span>Gathering data is critical for building businesses, but web scraping manually is tiresome and often leads to IP blocks and bans.

                              <span>Cron is a simple UNIX utility that manages and schedules the execution of commands in your computer. It was first developed in 1987 by Paul Vixie and it has since become an invaluable tool in Linux-based operating systems for both administrators and users alike.
    
Nowadays, there are a number of cron implementations and rewrites that you can easily install in your Linux system. Despite the differences, these programs all share the same Vixie Cron lineage.
    
As such, this article aims to provide a basic overview of how the original Vixie cron works, its syntax, and how you can use it to schedule tasks in your Linux system.

                              <span>Hi. After I updated my arch installation today and restarted, I started to get a very strange glitching effect on my desktop. It happens at random but consistent places, like my panel and on application previews. The glitch is not visible on screenshots. I&#x27;ve tried reinstalling the Nvidia drivers, but that didn&#x27;t help. Dmesg and the journal report no problem. Iv&#x27;e also reset my Xorg config, but that also didn&#x27;t help. It&#x27;s also not related to gnome extentions.

 The problem is not hardware related, as it is completely fine in console and bios.
 I&#x27;m running GNOME 42.1 on X11 with nvidia proprietary drivers 515.43.04. 
 Edit: Forgot to mention OpenGL applications are also broken with the message:
  
X Error of failed request: BadWindow (invalid Window parameter) 
 Major opcode of failed request: 156 (NV-GLX) 
 Minor opcode of failed request: 4 () 
 Resource id in failed request: 0x3800002 
 Serial number of failed request: 45 
 Current serial number in output stream: 45

                              <span>Title says it all: I&#x27;ve found a bug and im unsure where to report it.
 When in install gdm, gnome-terminal, gnome-themes-extra and gnome-control-center, restart into gnome and open the control center, i cannot change any settings...
 I managed a few installes where I install the packages one by one and everything works fine. Maybe it&#x27;s a gnome issue, maybe it&#x27;s only on arch, where should i go to report this?

                              <span>My internet was working fine, connecting automatically through iwd and whatnot.
 Then, out of nowhere, my AP stopped showing when I scan and get-networks, other SSIDs do show, but my home one doesn&#x27;t. 
 I can, by the way, connect to it through my phone, a laptop, and other phones in the house, just not my Linux client.
 Being able to see other SSIDs means that the problem isn&#x27;t iwd, nor is it my Wi-Fi dongle, but my router/modem/ap, but I&#x27;m not sure, because it works fine with every other device.

                              <span>I’m looking for advice on how to keep the user accounts in sync across multiple btrfs subvolumes on the same ssd—usernames, passwords, etc. I’ve read about LDAP configuration, but since this would all be local, I was wondering if LDAP was the right way forward.
 My use case is I have a “recovery” subvolume for “ / “that I leave unaltered, and a “system” subvolume for “ / “ that’s for regular use. However, changes to the user on one are not reflected in the other.

                              <span>I bought a clone wireless x360 controller and I couldn&#x27;t get my laptop to see it as a wireless x360 controller. Usb_modeswitch didn&#x27;t work no matter what I did. Xpad, xpadneo, xow, xone were tested and none of those worked too. The computer thinks it&#x27;s a goddamn nintendo switch pro controller through the dongle but it&#x27;s seen as a generic x360 controller when connected with the cable. I am completely stumped it&#x27;s been at least painful 1.5 months trying to fix this. I had it working as it should on Ubuntu and Linux Mint. But I can&#x27;t make it work on arch.
 Edit: thank you, you beautiful bastards, I tried what worked on mint live boot and it works on arch now

Currently I am unable to see what goes on in the splash screen as the desktop loads really fast. It&#x27;s a not super important factor but I would love to know if it&#x27;s possible in some way.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve written many iso USB sticks (I do the Arch Linux one every month just so I have a up to date USB stick handy). Well, last month and this month I have been unable to write to USB sticks without becoming sudo. Did something change with etcher or is it something in Arch? I&#x27;m not sure. I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s something with etcher. I installed imagewriter just to try that one out but nope, I have to run that as sudo too. 
 Did something change with user permissions or something? I know I had no issues in April when I mad 4 USB sticks for friends who wanted to try Arch (They love it BTW). I&#x27;m confused as to what happened. 
 Why am I no longer able to write iso files to USB sticks without becoming sudo?

I have chroot&#x27;ed into the new system and used pacman -S vim and it says it installed correctly however when I try use vim to edit locale.gen I get the error: 
 vim: error while loading shared libraries: libperl.so: cannot open object file: no such file or directory

                              <span>Hello everyone, is there an SDK and IDE for STM32 development for Linux. Currently now I use arm-none-eabi GCC toolchain and openocd for firmware upload. Is there any thing like SDK? It would be good but if there isn&#x27;t any, I would write my one via documentation

So I stuck my head in the sand and now I&#x27;ve come up for air and noticed that the dependencies for nextcloud 23 in the repositories has php8. I&#x27;ve currently have this line in my pacman.conf:
 IgnorePkg &#x3D; nextcloud php php-apache php-apcu php-cgi php-dblib php-igbinary php-imagick php-imap php-intl php-memcached perl
 If I remove this line am I going to mess up everything?

                              <span>on my laptop using BSPWM everytime I have to enter my GPG passphrase there&#x27;s this little popup thing asking me for my password
 on my desktop running kde plasma I got this curses interface instead. 
 how do I make it so that GPG asks for password using popup prompt like on my laptop? since I sign my git commits, this makes me unable to commit my changes using fugitive plugin in neovim, I have to exit neovim, commit my changes, then open neovim again, which is very inconvenient
 I&#x27;m using the exact same dotfiles, so I doubt it has anything to do with this (shell config, env variables and all that)

                              <span>Il mercato offre un numero sempre crescente di dispositivi per la smart home che possono essere gestiti a distanza utilizzando lo smartphone o i comandi vocali.La lampada LED smart da soffitto con ventilatore è in offerta fino al prossimo 30 giugno a soli 69,99 euro con spedizione dai magazzini europei.Si tratta di un oggetto circolare installabile a soffitto, di diametro pari a 54 cm e spessore di circa 18 cm, che permette di illuminare l&#x27;ambiente grazie alla lampada LED integrata e alla possibilità di scegliere tra tre diverse temperature di colore: 3000K, 4500K e 6000K. In questo modo si può ottenere una luce calda, un bianco neutro o oppure una luce più fredda.

Tutti i parametri sono regolabili mediante l&#x27;app su smartphone: la connessione con la lampada smart avviene infatti via Bluetooth.</span>

                              <span>Huawei è l&#x27;azienda che forse più di tutti ha investito sulla creazione di un ecosistema alternativo a quello di Google: con HMS Core l&#x27;azienda ha proposto una valida alternativa lasciando comunque agli sviluppatori la facoltà di creare applicazioni Android compatibili anche con i servizi dell&#x27;azienda di Mountain View.L&#x27;ideatore della nota distribuzione Mandrake Linux, Gaël Duval, ha presentato il suo Murena One, uno smartphone che vuole distinguersi per l&#x27;impegno sul piano della tutela della privacy e dei dati degli utenti.Duval racconta di aver sviluppato il sistema operativo sul quale si basa Murena One stanco del duopolio Android-iOS e della massiccia raccolta di dati che viene posta in essere.Non aspettatevi però di trovare Linux all&#x27;interno di Murena One: lo smartphone poggia il suo funzionamento su un fork di Android chiamato /e/ che abbina buona parte del codice sorgente del progetto Google AOSP (Android Open Source Project) con quello di LineageOS, una delle ROM più apprezzate.

Nel sistema /e/ la maggior parte dei servizi Google (non tutti) vengono sostituiti con delle implementazioni open source totalmente svincolate dal lavoro dell&#x27;azienda di Mountain View.Ci sono ad esempio librerie e app che forniscono servizi di mappe, geolocalizzazione, messaggistica, uno store basato sul repository non ufficiale Clean APK e così via.Gli utenti possono ovviamente installare la maggior parte delle app di Google e le migliaia di quelle esistenti per Android.</span>
