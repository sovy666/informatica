                              <span>As a precautionary measure, people and organizations hide their Wi-Fi networks, especially when it isn’t for public use. They choose not to broadcast the SSID so that when people turn on their Wi-Fi, it doesn’t appear on the list of available networks to connect to. Your best friend might hide their Wi-Fi network from their roommate and others in their building, but that also locks you out. This tutorial shows you how to connect to hidden Wi-Fi networks via the taskbar and Windows settings.

                              <span>Im running newly installed KDE plasma, on a dual boot with windows. I was able to run it fine until I ran a system update which apparently seems to break things quite often. I am not able to do anything during the boot, and single user mode detects no keyboard, but i can chroot from a USB. I&#x27;ve tried any solutions i&#x27;ve come across but they didn&#x27;t work. I would provide more info or logs, but i am completely new to linux so i have no idea what i would be looking for.

                              <span>I just got a NanoPi R5S for eventual use as a home automation server (and potentially as a router and VPN server). It has a Rockchip RK3568B2 ARM Cortex-A55n ARM processor. I am struggling with what OS to put on it. Obviously I cannot put Arch proper on it because it is an ARM architecture, but I really like Arch because the packages tend to be up to date and it is easy to package new software and add it to a local repository. My only experience with ARM devices are some old Raspberry Pis running Raspbian and a couple of old routers running OpenWrt. Most of my x86 systems run Arch although I have to support a couple of sytems that run Debian. 
 I guess I am thinking between Debian, Arch and OpenWRT. What distro would you choose?

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m having this weird issue where I&#x27;m playing a video in firefox or mpv but mostly firefox, where suddenly the video stops, the audio keeps playing but the whole window becomes unresponsive, the only way to solve it is to close the window, and it happens quite frequently, is not exactly the end of the world but is annoying and it happened also with Zoom.

                              <span>Hey, wassup. I just strarted using arch linux
 Very unsurprsingly it took me few good reinstall and scouring through the internet
 Unsurprisingly I&#x27;m using KDE(wayland) and I really wanted to try i3 so it&#x27;s KDE+i3
 ​
 I followed 2 videos and my intuition with archinstall:
 muta&#x27;s arch linux build
 LearnLinuxTv - how to install arch linux full guide
 ​
 shame with both of these, I could not get the last step of installing just plasma and going with it
 so after trying for a good few days, i went with archinstall and knowledge from installing with their techniques, it was SO EASY!
 ​
 Now, I will set my KDE environment as minimal. All the suggestions are welcome.
 I hope y&#x27;all have a great day ahead!

                              <span>I am kinda stumped on this problem, and I am hoping someone here can provide some guidance.
 Booting installation media with UEFI, and when I try to select the option to start the installation the screen goes black and nothing else comes up. On my hard drives I have a broken Ubuntu system and a Windows system that was working until I installed amd graphics drivers for my new gpu. I used an nvidia gpu prior.
 I initially tried re-installing windows, but the windows installation media does not work either. I had been meaning to install arch back on my pc, so I figured this was a good time. However the arch installation media does not work either.
 I am aware of the grub kernel parameters and kernal mode settings, but I do not have much experience with them. It seems people have had this problem before and the solution is to add &quot;nomodeset&quot; as a kernel parameter. This however does nothing for me. The screen continues to go black after adding new valid and invalid parameters.
 I have also tried running the installation media with a BIOS boot, but my keyboards do not work in the arch menu for bios boot. I have a fancy keyboard and an old basic keyboard that always works when the fancy one does not.

                              <span>Now that Firefox 103.0 has just been released, people are everywhere asking when it will be coming to their distribution.
 In Arch it already is, but I always wonder how they do things.
 In my case I have tried other distributions, like Tumbleweed, Fedora or LMDE, and I have always found more problems in those distributions than in Arch.
 Distributions that, in theory, should be more stable, since they do not publish updates until their programs are well tested, so I wonder how they do things in Arch so that, in my case, I hardly get problems with the latest versions of the programs, while in the others always appears something (Firefox....Plasma....Dolphin ...) that usually gives some other program.
 It is true that I like to keep my system with very few packages installed and I hardly use anything from AUR but, for example, no matter how minimalist I make the installation of Tumbleweed (as its installer allows it) I always end up having problems, usually small problems, it is true, but they do not appear in Arch.
 Does anyone else usually have less problems with Arch packages, even if they are more up to date than the other distributions?

                              <span>Some months ago I started getting an &quot;ambiguous output redirect&quot; error everytime a new tcsh shell is started. I&#x27;ve removed my ~/.cshrc and the problem persists and I also see this under the root-account where I don&#x27;t normally use tcsh, so it doesn&#x27;t appear to be related to anything in my home-directory.
 Does anyone have tips or tricks for helping to track down the source of the error? 
 The only redirect I found in system files is at /etc/profile.d/debuginfod.csh and it appears to be well-formed.

I followed the arch wiki and created a 20-amdgpu.conf and put the option for no tearing and freesync to on. the tearfree worked and it changed from auto to on but the freesync(vrr)is still 0. this command xrandr --output HDMI-A-0 --set vrr_capable 1
 it worked but the change dont persist on reboot

 I have tried to set the partition flags diag, hidden and msftres in various combinations but that did not work out. msftres hides the partition in the disk management tool of windows but not in the file explorer. I need a solution that isn&#x27;t bound to one windows installation and has to be set up on the next one as well. I need something that hides my partitions no matter in which device I plug the drive in.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve tried so many different things without success that I resort to asking here. I&#x27;m trying to get python3.10 on my raspberry pi which runs an ARM1176 processor with the armv6l architecture.
 My first and most obvious attempt was to run a QEMU machine with the same OS and architecture, that way I could just compile there. I couldn&#x27;t get a VM with the same architecture, the closest I got to it was running something similar to
 qemu-system-arm -machine raspi1ap -cpu arm1176 -kernel &quot;./vmlinuz&quot; -initrd &quot;./initrd.gz&quot; -cdrom file&#x3D;debian-11.4.0-armhf-netinst.iso 
 This would just give me a black screen and max a processor, even though I got the kernel and initrd from the right place for the iso (I got it working this way for another architecture). Prior to this I did get one ARM machine to boot and compile okay, but I didn&#x27;t have the right machine and cpu parameters so the executables wouldn&#x27;t run on the pi.
 Then, I went on to the second most obvious option which is to use the AUR packages for ARM cross-compilation. I managed to install them, but the executables wouldn&#x27;t run because I had the wrong version of libc with them. I tried matching the gcc version from the pi, which is 10.2.1, the git from the AUR gave me 10.2.0 but that version required libc&gt;&#x3D;2.33 when the pi has libc version 2.31.
 One final attempt was to run a QEMU machine of the same Debian version but x86_64, and within it to cross-compile. That also failed because they don&#x27;t include the machine armv6 anymore in their cross-compilers, so you would need to get the cross-compiler from some other shady source.

                              <span>Distro: i am using manjaro i3 community version what i want: and i want to execute the feh command to set wallpapers from my wallpapers directory randomly and i use the watch command to repeat that process after every x amount of time but apparently systemd does not support wildcards
 systemd user i am using the systemd for the current user with the --user flg for anyone wondering about it.
 solutions i tried: 1. i tried to escape it by using the command line tool systemd-escape but it has the same problem i think systemd first converts the escaped characters back to the normal and then executes it and the problem comes back does anyone knows how to execute the wildcards in any other way
  
i have tried to execute it by using a shell script and then execute the shell script but it does nothingi also tried to do the ExecStart&#x3D;/bin/bash -c &#x27;watch -n 5 feh --randomize --bg-fill ~/wallpapers/* &gt; /dev/null&#x27; it didn&#x27;t worked| command i desire to execute: watch -n 6 feh --randomize --bg-fill ~/Dotfiles/wallpaper/* &gt; /dev/null this is the command i wanted to execute
  
Note If i use the feh --bg-fill /path/to/wallpaper it sets the wallpaper i want to use the --randomize flag to change wallpapers randomly thats why i need the wildcard

                              <span>I plan on creating a USB drive with arch on it that can be used pretty much anywhere. Since I also want to add an NTFS partition so I can still use it as a regular USB drive I wonder if it&#x27;s possible to use the second partition on a drive as a legacy boot partition.
 I would partition the USB drive like this: 1. NTFS (USB functionality) 2. FAT32 (legacy boot) 3. FAT32 (UEFI boot) 4. EXT4 (Linux)
 Windows sadly only shows the first partition on a USB drive when plugged in.

                              <span>It started with missing taskbar that I restored by deleting plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrcfrom ~/.config. I reapplied my visual settings from previous working setup step by step manually. It worked fine until next reboot, I started noticing this. I get this corrected by restarting plasma session running the following commands:
 kquitapp5 plasmashell
 kstart5 plasmashell
 However it defaults to this broken state after waking from sleep or reboot. To me it looks like KDE packages got corrupted in some way in the last update.
 I wonder if anybody faced this weird GUI issues before and found fix. I am considering downgrading Plasma to 5.24 LTS for more stability if that is available option.

                              <span>Wondering how to uninstall a package and ignore the dependencies it breaks.
 Specifically jack2 while I&#x27;m troubleshooting audio and microphone.
 I want to avoid a pacman -Rsc because I&#x27;d end up with a broken system. If there was something like an Explicit or Ignore option to bypass the warnings for just the one package, that would be helpful
 What are your suggestions?
 EDIT:
 Thanks u/needsleep31 - Love the user name.
 I removed jack2 with pacman -Rdd jack2 Installed wireplumber and pulseaudio. Then as a secondary change, I made sure that both the internal Mic and the onboard Sound card were enabled.
 Rebooted after each update. Internal Mic is now working.
 EDIT 2: To be clear, I have already installed pipewire-jack

                              <span>I am trying to set up duplicati (backup software) so that it can access my home directory to back it up. This seemed like a good fit for ACLs, so my first thought was to use those. ACLs should be enabled on my ext4 filesystem, and as expected tune2fs -l shows &quot;acl&quot;, and /proc/mounts does not show &quot;noacl&quot;.
 Duplicati runs as the user &quot;duplicati&quot; in the group &quot;duplicati&quot; (I&#x27;ve confirmed this with systemctl status duplicati.service). So, I tried to give access with: setfacl -R -m &#x27;g:duplicati:rw&#x27; $HOME. However, duplicati still complained about permissions errors. I tried sudo -g duplicati ls $HOME, and it correctly listed my home directory. So then I tried to set it up to work with the user &quot;duplicati&quot;, not the group, with setfacl -R -m &#x27;u:duplicati:rw&#x27; $HOME. After that, running sudo -u duplicati ls $HOME shows a permissions error.
 getfacl $HOME gives:
 # file: home/vikingofrock # owner: vikingofrock # group: vikingofrock user::rwx user:duplicati:rw- group::--- group:duplicati:rw- mask::rw- other::--- 
 So, my questions are:
  
Why can the duplicati group access my home directory (as checked via sudo), but not the duplicati user?
 Why can&#x27;t duplicati (the software) seem to access my home directory, despite being in the duplicati group (which apparently has access)?
 Is there a different set-up I should be using to get this to work? I&#x27;d rather not just give global permissions to let everything access my home directory if I can avoid it.

                              <span>Arch Linux uses systemd that has everything compiled in it. I thought if i can easily use my own compiled packages of systemd, linux and linux-firmware with only my needed stuff compiled in. So i can use only init part of systemd.

For instance, multitasking mode (aka split screen or multi window mode) allows you to run multiple apps at the same time on your phone’s screen. In this article we’ll share the best tips to make the most of split screen on Samsung Galaxy Fold phones.
    
Note: Split screen works on both the cover and the main screen of foldable phones. You can also multitask in either landscape or portrait mode.

Amazon ha annunciato oggi che Drive chiuderà i battenti alla fine del 2023.Presentato come servizio di archiviazione cloud sicuro per i clienti Amazon al fine di effettuare il backup dei propri file, Drive offre 5 GB di spazio gratis per tutti gli utenti e la possibilità di accedere da Web oltre che tramite app Android e iOS.L&#x27;abbandono di Amazon Drive si concretizzerà attraverso una serie di tappe successive: il 31 ottobre 2022 Amazon rimuoverà le app Drive dagli store di Google ed Apple mentre dal 31 gennaio 2023 non saranno più accettati nuovi caricamenti di file sul cloud. Dal 31 dicembre 2023 gli utenti di Amazon Drive non potranno più visualizzare o scaricare i contenuti conservati sui server dell&#x27;azienda guidata da Jeff Bezos.Amazon suggerisce a tutti coloro che si servono del servizio Drive di scaricare i dati in locale prima di questa data limite.Nel caso in cui gli utenti dovessero incontrare difficoltà nel download di file pesanti oppure di un gran numero di elementi memorizzati su Amazon Drive, i tecnici della società suggeriscono di ricorrere al client desktop di Amazon Photos: esso consente di scaricare più di 5 GB o 1.000 file per volta.L&#x27;abbandono di Amazon Drive non avrà alcun effetto su Amazon Photos, il servizio che consente di archiviare sul cloud foto e video.Per gli abbonati Amazon Prime è assicurato il caricamento di un numero illimitato di foto, di qualunque peso e con qualsiasi risoluzione.Per approfondire, Amazon ha pubblicato una pagina contenente le risposte alle domande frequenti sulla chiusura di Drive e le istruzioni per recuperare per tempo i propri dati..</span>

                              <span>Le vendite di bici elettriche hanno fatto segnare, nell&#x27;ultimo periodo, un importante segno positivo. Il fatto è che trovare prodotti che sappiano coniugare la qualità con il prezzo non è affatto semplice.La bici elettrica pieghevole NIUBILITY B16 con motore da 350W, 36V, batteria da 10,4 Ah e velocità massima pari a 25 km/h è un prodotto davvero molto interessante, peraltro realizzato da un&#x27;azienda da anni specializzata in questa tipologia di oggetti.NIUBILITY B16 è disponibile al prezzo scontato di 479,99 euro con spedizione dai magazzini europei del venditore. Per ottenere lo sconto promozionale è necessario digitare il codice coupon TCNYTB al momento dell&#x27;invio dell&#x27;ordine.

Realizzata in lega di alluminio, NIUBILITY B16 pesa circa 20 kg, dispone di ruote stabili da 16 pollici e misura 137 x 24 x 113 cm una volta aperta (78 x 35 x 65 cm quando ripiegata su se stessa).NIUBILITY B16 può essere utilizzata in due diverse modalità tra le quali c&#x27;è anche la pedalata assistita.Stando a quanto dichiarato dal produttore, la batteria da 10,4 Ah offre un&#x27;autonomia di circa 40-50 km con una singola ricarica (che richiede 4-6 ore).Il motore elettrico brushless da 350W è silenzioso e, grazie alla sua posizione, offre un ottimo bilanciamento della bici contribuendo ad assicurare una stabilità ancora maggiore.</span>

                              <span>LockBit è uno dei ransomware che stanno facendo più danni nell&#x27;ultimo periodo. Non ha bisogno di presentazioni perché praticamente ogni giorno il gruppo di cybercriminali che ne segue lo sviluppo oppure i tanti &#x27;affiliati&#x27; aggiungono nuovi nomi all&#x27;elenco delle aziende prese di mira dal ransomware stesso.Abbiamo visto cos&#x27;è LockBit 3.0 e come funziona l&#x27;ultima versione del ransomware.I ricercatori di Sentinel Labs hanno scoperto una novità: LockBit 3.0 ha cominciato a sfruttare Windows Defender per caricare librerie DLL malevole che si occupano di decodificare e installare beacon Cobalt Strike. Ma andiamo con ordine.</span>

                              <span>Quando si parla di sistemi operativi la modalità kiosk prevede la possibilità di usare la macchina con forti limitazioni in modo che l&#x27;utente non possa far danni.Di solito la modalità kiosk si usa per i sistemi che devono limitarsi a erogare funzionalità specifiche o visualizzare presentazioni.Windows permetteva già di usare la modalità kiosk ma con Windows 11 cambia tutto. I responsabili del programma Windows Insider Amanda Langowski e Brandon LeBlanc hanno annunciato che a partire dalla versione di anteprima contrassegnata dal numero di build 25169 gli utenti di Windows 11 possono attivare e usare la nuova modalità kiosk.Quando abilitata la modalità kiosk multi-app di Windows 11 consente agli amministratori IT di decidere quali applicazioni sono accessibili e utilizzabili dagli utenti che effettuano il login con i rispettivi account.&#x27;Multi-app kiosk mode è uno strumento di Windows 11 che permette agli amministratori IT di selezionare una lista di applicazioni che possono essere eseguite sul dispositivo mentre tutte le altre funzionalità vengono bloccate&#x27;, scrivono Langowski e LeBlanc.Servendosi della nuova caratteristica di Windows 11 sarà possibile allestire configurazioni diverse per ciascun account su uno stesso dispositivo.</span>

                              <span>Capita spesso di lavorare con documenti PDF che espongono un messaggio a tutta pagina con la dizione &#x27;Bozza&#x27;, &#x27;Riservato&#x27;, &#x27;Confidenziale&#x27; e via dicendo. Questa soluzione grafica particolarmente invasiva che ha un effetto diretto sul layout del PDF si chiama filigrana o watermark: tutti i principali programmi per la gestione dei PDF consentono di aggiungerla, generalmente in obliquo a pagina intera. Interagire con i file PDF contenenti filigrane o watermark può essere fonte di distrazione ed è possibile quindi servirsi di un semplice metodo per eliminare l&#x27;elemento grafico superfluo.
Rimuovere filigrana o watermark dai documenti PDF
 Diamo per scontato che il file PDF sul quale si desidera intervenire per rimuovere filigrana o watermark sia sbloccato quindi liberamente gestibile.Il passaggio più ovvio per rimuovere il watermark consiste nell&#x27;utilizzare Adobe Acrobat Pro DC: dopo aver aperto il documento PDF che si desidera modificare basta fare clic sul pulsante Modifica PDF quindi su Filigrana, Rimuovi.La soluzione di Adobe, tuttavia, è a pagamento ed è possibile risolvere con i migliori strumenti per modificare PDF, molti dei quali sono gratuiti.
Rimozione del watermark con Microsoft Office
 Per chi utilizza Microsoft Office nelle versioni più recenti, una buona soluzione consiste nel cliccare sul menu File, Apri quindi selezionare il file PDF contenente il watermark.Alla comparsa del messaggio &#x27;Word convertirà il documento PDF in un documento Word modificabile&#x27; è sufficiente premere OK.</span>

                              <span>La condivisione del report finanziario di Intel relativo al secondo trimestre 2022 ha fatto emergere un importante aspetto. La società di Santa Clara si accinge a dismettere tutte le attività legate alla tecnologia Optane.Di Intel Optane e della tecnologia sviluppata di concerto con Micron che sta alla base del suo funzionamento (3D Xpoint) si parlava almeno dal 2015 ma solo nel 2017 cominciarono a fare capolino sul mercato i primi prodotti commerciali.Nell&#x27;articolo in cui spiegavamo cos&#x27;è Intel Optane abbiamo detto che si trattava di una tecnologia promettente, in grado potenzialmente di rivoluzionare il mercato dello storage.I moduli che Intel commercializzò permettevano di accelerare le prestazioni del sistema rimuovendo in larga parte il collo di bottiglia legato alle operazioni di lettura e, soprattutto, di scrittura effettuate sugli hard disk tradizionali.Con le soluzioni Optane DC Persistent Memory Intel ha poi cominciato, dal 2018, a guardare a prodotti evoluti capaci di combinare le funzionalità di RAM e SSD.Il fatto è che le soluzioni Optane non sono mai riuscite a fare breccia sul mercato.</span>

                              <span>I dati che si gestiscono in azienda, in ufficio o presso uno studio professionale hanno un valore immenso. Fermatevi soltanto un attimo a pensare cosa accadrebbe se improvvisamente perdeste i dati che ogni giorno utilizzate per svolgere le vostre attività. Come reagireste? Come potreste continuare a svolgere il vostro lavoro?Lo sanno bene quelle realtà aziendali che purtroppo sono state vittime di attacchi ransomware senza disporre di backup aggiornati dei dati.Un&#x27;infezione da ransomware che va a buon fine è una sconfitta per qualsiasi realtà aziendale, per gli amministratori IT e per le figure che si occupano di sicurezza. La cifratura dei dati da parte di un ransomware rappresenta infatti soltanto l&#x27;ultima fase di un attacco informatico nato molto prima e in grado di sfruttare evidenti lacune nella configurazione della rete, nella gestione dei permessi, nella condivisione delle risorse, nella protezione di server, workstation e singoli endpoint, nella mancata applicazione di aggiornamenti di sicurezza, nell&#x27;utilizzo di dispositivi insicuri, nella mancata adozione di strumenti centralizzati per la difesa dell&#x27;infrastruttura.Anche seguendo tutte le linee guida e utilizzando i migliori strumenti per la difesa del perimetro aziendale, è tuttavia impensabile avere la certezza di essere protetti al 100%.Per questo, come abbiamo spesso ricordato, è essenziale predisporre un efficace piano di disaster recovery.</span>

                              <span>Anche se i provider di telefonia ci vendono gli abbonamenti flat per Internet senza limiti di tempo e di dati, spesso sono costretti a rallentare la connessione di alcuni utenti per mantenere il bilanciamento nella trasmissione dei dati sulla loro rete. Questo rallentamento viene applicato quasi automaticamente quando viene rilevato un flusso proveniente dai servizi ad alto consumo di dati (come per esempio video in streaming 4K, scaricamento di file dalle reti P2P e gestione di un server di gioco multiplayer).
 Se anche noi siamo vittime di questo rallentamento volontario delle performance della nostra rete, nella guida che segue vi mostreremo i migliori trucchi per ripristinare la massima velocità anche quando il provider ci rallenta, così da poter continuare a scaricare o a vedere i fil…</span>

                              <span>Per disegnare a mano libera al computer Windows mette a disposizione Paint, un programma standard che viene usato in tutto il mondo e si trova tra gli accessori nel menu Start. Tutti, almeno una volta, l&#x27;hanno provato rinunciando subito però a disegnare qualcosa che non fosse qualche scarabocchio.
 Se vogliamo veramente disegnare con il PC dobbiamo utilizzare un programma diverso, che fornisca tutti gli strumenti professionali per disegnare e che renda possibile riconoscere subito il nostro tratto e la nostra bravura a disegnare senza dover utilizzare un foglio cartaceo.
 Nella guida che segue vi mostreremo i migliori programmi gratuiti per creare immagini nuove sul computer, aiutandoci magari con una tavoletta grafica adatta a disegnare.

                              <span>Hello,
 I am using NetworkManager, and am able to successfully connect to my and other&#x27;s home wifi and was able to connect to the public library wifi.
 However, I tried to connect to my jobs public wifi today (I work at a community college) using nmtui. While it said I had successfully connected , I could not ping debian.org (my usual tester) or browse the internet but I could ping 8.8.8.8 . This was just a public wifi with no sign-in page or anything. I used to be able to use the wifi there fine using this same install.
 I&#x27;ve done a lot of searching online but I am having trouble isolating my problem. (A lot of people have had similar issues for a variety of reasons).
 Any thoughts on where I should start for diagnosing this? I was going through the Networking page on the arch wiki and seeing if my config files looked okay. I&#x27;d like to develop the skills for fixing this in case I run into it again, I had a similar problem at the college I attend for school.
 ​
 Thank you in advance, I try to avoid bothering people on forums until I really hit a wall.

                              <span>I recently installed bspwm and a bunch of other stuff (because rice, I know) and since then my keymap has stopped working. Well, one of them. I use the swerty layout and ever since alt-gr isn&#x27;t recognized correctly on that keyboard. For anyone unaware, left alt and right alt (alt-gr) are two completely different keys on a Swedish (or otherwise european) layout, meaning that when alt-gr isn&#x27;t working I&#x27;m unable to write a lot of special characters such as :; [] etc. So a bit of an issue.
 Switching to a regular ISO keyboard with a standard ISO layout works fine and alt-gr is detected as it should. The issue is consistent across all DEs or WMs. The method of install is adding stuff to /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/se as well as /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.xml and those files are still intact and look as they should. 
 The keymap works just like it should other than that, the only issue is that alt-gr isn&#x27;t detected correctly.
 Using alt-gr on xev on swerty returns
 KeyPress event, serial 38, synthetic NO, window 0x3a00001, root 0x1e7, subw 0x0, time 19950654, (-1170,600), root:(610,637), state 0x0, keycode 108 (keysym 0xffea, Alt_R), same_screen YES, XLookupString gives 0 bytes: XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes: XFilterEvent returns: False 
 While using it on regular ISO (which is the correct interpretation) is
 KeyPress event, serial 38, synthetic NO, window 0x3a00001, root 0x1e7, subw 0x0, time 20382268, (-1191,663), root:(588,699), state 0x2000, keycode 108 (keysym 0xfe03, ISO_Level3_Shift), same_screen YES, XKeysymToKeycode returns keycode: 92 XLookupString gives 0 bytes: XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes: XFilterEvent returns: False 
 So clearly my swerty layout should return ISO_Level3_Shift rather than Alt_R
 I&#x27;m not sure where I should begin troubleshooting this, anyone got a pointer? I initially thought it was due to installing sxhkd but stopping that service makes no difference.
 Thanks for reading and any help.

                              <span>I tried to install pipewire on a fresh install a few months ago and wireplumber literally gave me a constant segfault on launch back then. Helvum did work, so I know that I had sound back then, but it required me to manually set the sound output on every new stream, so I installed pulseaudio instead. It worked well, but now I&#x27;d like to get access to easyeffects as well as just trying to move on to the latest stuff anyway.
 I don&#x27;t know if it is because pulseaudio was installed since, but Pipewire literally refuses to start.

                              <span>Plunging into arch and have had an interesting time during install. Image was verified, but I’m running into a handful of hiccups it seems, the concerning one being these errors after attempting to synchronize package databases:
 error: failed retrieving file &#x27;core.db&#x27; from repo.ialab.dsu.edu : Resolving timed out after 10000 milliseconds error: failed retrieving file *extra.db&#x27; from repo.ialab.dsu.edu: Resolving timed out after 10000 milliseconds error: failed retrieving file *community.db° from repo.ialab.dsu.edu: Resolving timed out after 10000 milliseconds warning: too many errors from repo.ialab.dsu.edu, skipping for the remainder of this transaction 
 Alongside the errors, the installation process is taking longer than I feel should be expected (not the setup, but the installation itself), pushing on an hour in.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have an audio interface (20 outputs) that I use on my desktop. To use this as a stereo card, so that applications do not mistake it as a surround card, I remap AUX0 and AUX1 to a stereo loopback sink. At least, I used to, using pipewire-media-session. I did this as shown below.
  { name &#x3D; libpipewire-module-loopback args &#x3D; { node.name &#x3D; &quot;Audient_iD44_Stereo&quot; node.description &#x3D; &quot;Audient iD44 Stereo&quot; capture.props &#x3D; { media.class &#x3D; &quot;Audio/Sink&quot; audio.position &#x3D; [ FL FR ] } playback.props &#x3D; { audio.position &#x3D; [ AUX0 AUX1 ] node.target &#x3D; &quot;alsa_output.usb-Audient_Audient_iD44-00.pro-output-0&quot; stream.dont-remix &#x3D; true node.passive &#x3D; true } } } 
 Previously I was using pipewire-media-session but now wireplumber seems to be what is required by pipewire. I cannot find any sources on how to configure wireplumber to do the same, and I find its documentation regarding config options extremely lacking. Is there anyone who knows how to solve this issue or that can point me to a good resource?

                              <span>Con il grande successo delle app di meeting e di videochiamate il microfono è diventato uno degli accessori più importanti del PC. Mentre prima veniva utilizzato soltanto da giocatori e videomaker, adesso è diventato uno strumento essenziale per partecipare alle riunioni in videocall o per chiamare amici e parenti direttamente dal PC.
 See il microfono non viene riconosciuto, non viene rilevato o non funziona potremmo incontrare serie difficoltà a fare meeting o ad avviare nuove videochiamate. Inoltre, a causa del cattivo uso del microfono può darsi che si verifichi un effetto eco durante una videoconferenza oppure che chi ci ascolta senta rumori di fondo o senta la nostra voce troppo bassa.
 Nella guida che segue vi mostreremo come risolvere i problemi col microfono del PC, passando in ra…</span>

                              <span>WhatsApp è l&#x27;app più utilizzata e &quot;spiata&quot; al mondo: non sorprende quindi che, per renderla più sicura, gli sviluppatori abbiamo deciso di introdurre la verifica in due passaggi e la possibilità di impostare una password per il backup cloud, così da rendere molto difficile rubare l&#x27;account anche nel caso in cui qualcuno riesca ad accedere al nostro numero di telefono (magari con tecniche avanzate come il SIM Swap).
 Il problema nasce quando siamo noi a dimenticare il PIN o la password di WhatsApp: in questo caso, anche se siamo i legittimi proprietari dell&#x27;account, rischiamo di rimanere fuori dalle nostre chat.
 Per fortuna è possibile ripristinare il PIN e la password di WhatsApp in maniera abbastanza semplice e indolore, avendo cura di utilizzare uno dei metodi di backup offerti dall&#x27;app…</span>

                              <span>Google punta a proporre i suoi Chromebook come sistemi veloci, completi, spesso economici che guardano alla produttività.Con una nota pubblicata sul blog dell&#x27;azienda Google ha presentato alcune delle novità che debutteranno nei prossimi mesi sui Chromebook.Innanzitutto è stato presentato un nuovo editor video e alcune nuove funzionalità per la modifica dei filmati con Google Foto.

L&#x27;app Google Foto già consente di manipolare singoli video utilizzando quello che è essenzialmente lo stesso insieme di strumenti per la modifica delle foto.Nel caso dei Chromebook, invece, Google presenta un editor tutto nuovo che permette di combinare più video su una timeline a traccia singola, aggiungere transizioni, titoli e applicare tutte le modifiche di base più frequentemente richieste da chi vuole produrre un buon filmato in pochi minuti.È possibile creare video da zero (si possono ovviamente aggiungervi anche delle foto), tagliare i filmati, regolarne luminosità, contrasto e molto altro ancora.Selezionando un tema e le persone (o gli animali domestici) protagoniste, Google Foto può  realizzare un film utilizzando clip video e foto.</span>
