 however, I download the iso image of w10 and make bootable usb with Ventoy but when I try to boot I got black screen always. Actually at first I tried to install w10 but it said there is no right partition so I shut down my computer during installation and never got in installation again.
 What do you think I got my bios fucked or something? Whst should I do. I change the bootable usb several times.

 If you see error message like:
 java.util.zip.ZipException: invalid entry CRC (expected 0x518510b5 but got 0x5bfe689e) 
 And you&#x27;re using zlib v1.2.12 then it&#x27;s zlib fault, downgrading to v1.2.11 works.

                              <span>Welp… I tried to set up a dual-booting system with Windows 11 and Arch and somehow managed for GRUB to not recognize any operating system at all, only giving me the option to go into EFI, which only shows me GRUB as a bootable “drive”. It was a relatively new machine so I don’t mind having to completely wipe my hard drive, but I hope there’s a way I don’t have to do that. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!

So I tested several other distros and I&#x27;m currently running debian, but the stable version of debian has outdated packages as hell, this is so remarkable that I couldn&#x27;t even run pipewire correctly on bullseye. So not to stray so much from my current debian scenario I thought about using testing or sid, but I saw that arch was more stable than the same. Even though I&#x27;ve used arch before and loved it, I&#x27;m confused about the kernel to use (I&#x27;ll comment on this in a few lines), before formatt…</span>

                              <span>Hello, having
  avoid-resampling &#x3D; true resample-method &#x3D; soxr-vhq ; just for the case when needed? default-sample-format &#x3D; s32le default-sample-rate &#x3D; 44100 alternate-sample-rate &#x3D; 48000 ... 
 in the /etc/pulse/daemon.conf.
 I have two flac files (format told by ffmpeg -i): - Audio: flac, 44100 Hz, stereo, s16 - Audio: flac, 96000 Hz, stereo, s32 (24 bit)
 When I have default-sample-rate &#x3D; 44100 the first one is played with resample-method &#x3D; (null) and not the second one (the second one uses the above-mentioned resample method).
 When I have default-sample-rate &#x3D; 96000 the second one is played with resample-method &#x3D; (null) and not the first one. Alternate sample rate is ignored.
 (this has been acquired using pacmd list-sink-inputs)
 Question.
 Please, how to config Pulseaudio to allow avoiding resampling for multiple sample rates simultaneously?
 Config. - current stable Arch - not using pipewire-pulse just plain pulseaudio - using external USB DAC capable of 32bit/192kHz - alsa_output.usb-Schiit_Audio_I_m_Fulla_Schiit-00.iec958-stereo/#0: I&#x27;m Fulla Schiit Digital Stereo (IEC958)

                              <span>I&#x27;m having the exact issue that this guy was having here:
  
Hey all, I use musicbee as a music player on windows, and I&#x27;ve found it really convenient to be able to use the exact library files for it on both linux and windows on my dual-booted desktop. The only real problem I&#x27;m having (- other than non-latin characters not showing up correctly) is that I&#x27;m not able to make any edits to files within musicbee as every time I try to eg, like a song, export a playlist etc, I get the error &#x27;Sharing violation. This file cannot be updated as another application has this file open at the same time&#x27;. 
 Checking fuser on the files in question show that they are used by &#x27;MusicBee.exe&#x27; and &#x27;wineserver&#x27;, probably meaning that wineserver is what&#x27;s causing musicbee to lock up on making these edits. Anyone know of a fix for this?
  
Only, the music is on my Linux Mint, ext4 drive, so I&#x27;m not sure what is happening. The comments mention this might be a permissions issue, but I don&#x27;t have enough linux knowledge to be able to follow the comments or otherwise figure out how to resolve this error.
 Any ideas?
 EDIT: Was able to figure out how to get CJK fonts installed (mostly) using Winetricks, but the sharing violation issue still persists.

 But I just could not find the actual interface to the temperature information on the sysfs. Where is it?

                              <span>The goal is to remove some of the dependencies of KDE meta-packages (like kde-multimedia-meta and kde-network-meta). For example I don&#x27;t need kdenlive, falkon, konqueror, konversation..... more....
 I know I can remove the meta-packages (and that&#x27;s what I started to do) , but I thought that new packages might be added and i would like to learn about them.
 So i can either (1) use some tool to watch and notify me of new dependencies on the meta-packages; or i can (2) keep the metapackages, remove the unneded dependencies and prevent their auto-reinstallation with some tool; or i can (3) remove the metapackages and only keep the ones i want to, using some other tool to monitor for new dependencies on the meta-packages.
 Has anyone used something to do what i want to do?
 EDIT: I&#x27;ve already seen about IgnorePackage and i&#x27;ve red that it only prevents upgrading a package once it&#x27;s installed, but does not prevent automatic reinstallation of dependency. I have not tried it personally.
 I&#x27;ve also heard about creating a dummy package to lie to the OS, but my gut feeling does not like that.
 EDIT 2: Maybe it&#x27;ll be best for me to make my own tool to fetch/check for new packages in kde-* groups and possibly use groups.

 Thing is, discord doesn&#x27;t seem to recognize the newly installed fonts? Or is there a way to force discord to use these fonts? I&#x27;m still a beginner on ARCH and I&#x27;m using GNOME if that helps.

 by the way I&#x27;m using a laptop but the battery is taken out so linux just recognizes it as a desktop pc.
 Any ideas as to whats causing this?
 Thanks!

 Where is  bound in the chroot? How is that bind location referenced when prepare() and package() are run?

 EDIT: because someone asked me to put the solution here, I had to add ‘—removeable’ to the grub-install command. I’ve also included my entire written installation instructions if people would like to follow along to install Arch. Keep in mind this may not be perfect, as I am a beginner my self, and this was written for UEFI systems using the GPT label. If you’re not using UEFI, you can check out the ArchWiki to see how this installation process differs.

                              <span>Hi guys, many years ago I created zaread office/ebook viewer. It was meant initially as a &quot;personal use&quot; script I made mainly because I hated being forced to open LibreOffice (with its RAM usage and bloaty buttons) every time I needed to see the content of a doc file. I uploaded the script on github in case anyone needed a similiar thing, then just forgot about it.
 Then few days ago, checking github after a long time, I discovered that many people adopted it and even made some patches. Also I discovered that a person of good will created and maintained the related AUR package, named zaread-git.
 So, moved by the sense of guilt of my disappearing, I checked the pull requests made in the years, reordered the code, fixed some bugs I discovered and committed on github. Then I reported the updates in its AUR page. The problem is that the creator of zaread-git AUR package is not an Arch user anymore and asks for a new maintainer.
 Now I feel the responsability of maintaining it, my problem is that, despite being a &gt;10 years Arch user... I never did it before. To me AUR packages always have been one of those &quot;magic&quot; things the computer does to simplify your work.I would like to give to it a mandatory dependency (zathura) and some optional dependencies (libreoffice, calibre, md2pdf).
 Does anyone know if there are tutorials that explain how to start from scratch? I know that there is an helper (clean-chroot-manager) but its man page is a bit thin.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I am trying to recover some data from an USB disk: it is too large to create a local image before starting.I already successfully used testdisk like that in the past but on a different distro (Ubuntu 20.04).
 I am currently experiencing hangs under Archlinux after I select &quot;Analyse&quot; and then &quot;Quick search&quot;. 
 The process stays in &quot;D+&quot; status (uninterruptible sleep (usually IO) in foregound) and there&#x27;s nothing else I can do besides rebooting. 
 I was expecting the usual &quot;real time&quot; progress information, but it simply freezes.I also tested the &quot;wip&quot; package from AUR, but it doesn&#x27;t make any difference.Using testdisk on a different drive just works, so I think it&#x27;s an hardware-related issue.
 Is there a way to fix/workaround this issue and go on?

                              <span>Sometimes, when an app has outlived its usefulness, you’ll want to uninstall it to make way for new ones. Uninstalling apps is easy enough: simply go to the Apps list, find the app, and hit the Uninstall button. But it’s not so easy to completely uninstall apps on Android.
    
Unfortunately, for those who like a clean file system, some apps will leave behind “orphaned files” after uninstallation on Android devices. These files were created by the app so that it can do its job if they weren’t properly deleted after the app was uninstalled. This can get annoying when your device’s system is slowly clogged up by files and folders that aren’t being used. The solution then is to find a way to reliably remove leftover app data.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m trying to dualboot Arch and Android x86 and I have troubles getting grub to detect Android partition.
 For now I modified the /etc/grub.d/40_custom to contain
 #!/bin/sh exec tail -n +3 $0 menuentry &quot;Android-x86&quot; { set root&#x3D;&#x27;(hd2,7)&#x27; linux /android-2021-06-26/kernel quiet root&#x3D;/dev/ram0 androidboot.hardware&#x3D;eeepc acpi_sleep&#x3D;s3_bios,s3_mode SRC&#x3D;/android-2021-06-26 initrd /android-2021-06-26/initrd.img} 
 I&#x27;m not sure if my drive should be hd2,7 since I have one sata drive and two NVME drives in the system.
 I also found out about the android path name by mounting the nvme drive I installed it to and it had a folder named android-2021-06-26 inside… so I guess that&#x27;s correct.
 After booting this entry grub throws an error:
 ACPI BIOS Error (bug): Failure creating name object [\_SB.PC10.SATO.PRT4._GTF], AE_ALREADY_EXISTS (20200925/dswloadZ-327) ACPI Error: AE_ALREADY_EXISTS, During name lookup/catalog (20200925/psobject-Z21) Detecting Android-x86... found at /dev/nvme0n1p7 
 But after that nothing, screen goes to black and stays like this.Keep in mind that I had to rewrite this error so I might have made some typos.
 Any help is highly appreciated!Also, I&#x27;m not entirely sure if this is the best subreddit to post this to, should I post it in a different one?

                              <span>Hi everyone.
 In this post I&#x27;m going to show you how to setup an AMD GPU for Arch Linux, while it is much more straight-forward than setting up an nvidia card , new users may still benefit from this guide.
 So first you will need to have at-least functional minimal Arch Linux Installation With Networking.
 And then we will proceed :
 1 - Getting xorg Drivers.
  
Run the following Command to install xorg packages :
  
​
 sudo pacman -S xorg xorg-drivers xf86-video-amdgpu 
 2 - Getting Mesa OpenGL Drivers. (Open-source)
  
Run following Command to install mesa OpenGL packages :
  
​
 sudo pacman -S mesa 
 3 - Getting 32-bit version of Mesa OpenGL Drivers. (Open-source) (Optional)
 To install the proprietary OpenGl Driver (Optional)

                              <span>Everytime i watch a video on YouTube or have online live lecture for uni my cpu temps go up. Normally my laptop cpu is around 28-30 C° but when starting videos it goes up to 50 or more sometimes and after 40 C° my fans turn up to really loud (is there a solution for this too?). And im a Computer Science Student ive done many big projects with this laptop and no matter how big the code is and what it does my cpu temps never go higher than 35 C° but for a yt video my fans start rotating.
 Anybody has some suggestions? 
 i use Firefox on a ThinkPad t14s with amd processor (and endeavour is my os but due its based on arch i want to try it in this community)

                              <span>Pacman needs to update something on the EFI partition (mount point &#x27;/boot&#x27;) as part of routine upgrade, but there is not enough space on the 190MB EFI partition shared by Windows 11 and GRUB. I can&#x27;t expand the partition because there is a 128MB &quot;reserved partition&quot; immediately to the right of the EFI partition.
 I have 4.00 GB unallocated to the right of Partition 3 (Windows 11) which I would like to tap into to expand the EFI partition. Any idea how to move around the space safely?
 Partition table from Windows diskpart:
 Partition ### Type Size Offset
 ------------- ---------------- ------- -------
 Partition 1 System 190 MB 1024 KB (EFI)
 Partition 2 Reserved 128 MB 191 MB (reserved)
 Partition 3 Primary 843 GB 319 MB (Windows 11)

 However, it seems to behave just fine.
 When using mesa-amber, it give me the error:

 For reference, the X60 has a GMA950 gpu.

                              <span>Hello everyone. I have connected an HP ENVY 4500 multifunction device that works without problems both for printing and scanning.
 If I want to print something it does it the first time and without any problems. If I want to scan something, it always asks me for a password (and I don&#x27;t care, since I&#x27;m the only one using this PC) and it never recognizes the device the first time. I need to turn my HP ENVY off and on and then yes, it recognizes it right away, and I can scan without any problems.
 I have cups.service and cups.socket enabled, as well as added my user to the sys group, apart from the wheel, but I don&#x27;t really know why it doesn&#x27;t recognize the computer at first and asks me for a password, something that doesn&#x27;t happen with other distro: Manjaro, Endeavouros or openSUSE Tumbleweed.
 Any help to solve this problem will be very welcome, thanks. Regards, Juan.

                              <span>Hi. 
 I usually use proprietary nvidia drivers at the moment it is (510.60.02). I use rtx 2080ti
 To install I use DKMS:
 sudo pacman -S nvidia-dkms nvidia-utils lib32-nvidia-utils nvidia-settings vulkan-icd-loader lib32-vulkan-icd-loader lib32-opencl-nvidia opencl-nvidia libxnvctrl
 Then:
 sudo mkinitcpio -P
 What is the problem:
 I noticed that when watching videos (for example, YouTube), my GPU is not loaded at all, but the processor is loaded.
 In this case, the browser itself starts to work more slowly when the video is running.
 This can be seen in scrolling or animations. (Like 30fps, lmao)
 With the video running, it is also noticeable how the system itself becomes slower, dragging windows and resizing them occurs as in 30fps.
 As soon as I put the video on pause - the problem does not appear.
 ​
 Please help me with this problem. Do I need to install some packages for the system to work correctly?
 ​
 pc configuration:
 AMD Ryzen 7 2700X (16) @ 4.075GHz
 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti
 RAM 32GB

                              <span>I just recieved my first Tuxedo laptop and of course instantly flattened the drive and installed arch. During the install process, it already became aparent that the upper third of the screen wasn&#x27;t refreshing properly.
 After setting up KDE with sddm, the issue became much more visible (because you can simply see it easier in the gui).
 I never had issues of that kind. On my other system, I&#x27;m running on NVidia with a weird uwqhd resolution and everything works fine. The Infinitybook has an Intel Iris Xe and 2880x1800 display. I&#x27;ve tried the fallback to the modesetting driver as stated on the Intel page in the wiki but didn&#x27;t get X to launch without the xf86-video-intel package installed.
 Has anyone had similar issues? It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;m tinkering with Intel APU stuff so I don&#x27;t even know what I&#x27;m really dealing with. Also, the point that the issue is also visible in the tty confuses me.
 Edit: I was able to get the issue fixed now! Thank you so much to /u/w0330 for pointing the solution out. Everything works like a charm now, in tty and KDE.
 i915.enable_psr&#x3D;0 as kernel parameter was the correct solution but somehow it didn&#x27;t work in the beginning, I guess because I messed something up.
 If you encounter the same issue using Intel Iris Xe graphics, try setting the given parameter, don&#x27;t use xf86-video-intel and don&#x27;t provide any additional launch information for xorg.
