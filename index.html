                              <span>This sounds like a easy question but it has been a long time and I can&#x27;t figure out the why.
 In any Linux I&#x27;ve tried, closing the lid and reopening it makes it a black screen, no input, devices disabled, and the processor fan goes to the MAX. Not kidding. It gets LOUD. In normal operation this barely ever happens if at all.
 I&#x27;ve done my research. It seems to be a problem with Bay Trail Processors (which my Pentium N3450 is), relating to something called the &quot;CState&quot; of the processor (whatever that is). Setting intel_idle.max_cstate&#x3D;1 should&#x27;ve done the trick.
 The thing is, it doesn&#x27;t. My laptop doesn&#x27;t do what I want. I have to always set closing the lid to do nothing on the power settings of whatever I&#x27;m using.
 On Windows this doesn&#x27;t ocurr at all, the system is able to suspend just fine. It seems to dislike Linux.
 Does someone have a 2nd opinion on what could I do? The Arch Wiki says &quot;just downgrade the kernel lmao&quot; but I have the feeling it won&#x27;t work.

                              <span>Many people confuse Notion and Notion.site, using them interchangeably, when in fact, there are noteworthy differences between the two. The former is an “all-in-one workspace” software for note-taking, planning, managing, and organizing information for increased efficiency and productivity. Notion.site, on the other hand, is a domain extension that allows users to host a Notion Workspace for personal and collective content sharing. The amazing thing about Notion.site is that it allows people to save pages from it to their private Workspace. This post will show just how seamlessly you can do this.

 I&#x27;ve tried to uninstall and reinstall my VirtualBox, restarted my PC, and even downloaded new ISO files but no luck so far. Any idea ?💡

                              <span>Hey, hope you all doing great. So I’ve recently bought an asus vivobook s15 with amd ryzen with the igpu and I’ve started to install arch on it, and after exiting the live environment I felt that system freezes and I installed kde and it crashes all the time and it’s completely unusable. ( I installed amd open source driver for gpu and amd microcode for cpu and it even freezes when I try ctr alt f2 or the others) so I’m wondering what did I do wrong ( btw a reinstall did not help). I would be really glad if you can help me get this running cause it’s my first time running arch on a new laptop. Thanks again :)

                              <span>I&#x27;m running Arch with KDE and I am forced to use wifi at my place.
 Today, while I was using my PC, out of nowhere I got disconnected of my access point and it wouldn&#x27;t connect back, meanwhile the wifi would work fine in my Android phone. I tried making a hotspot with my phone my it would also not connect.
 Checking dmesg I could see it would randomly authenticate and assosciate but eventually I would get a: wlan0: deauthenticating from MAC_ADDRESS by local choice (Reason: 3&#x3D;DEAUTH_LEAVING)
 After doing some research I found this could be a NetworkManager wpa_supplicant concurrency problem, so I tried doing: sudo systemctl disable --now wpa_supplicant
 And turns out after doing this it could actually connect to my wifi (not to my phone hotspot tho). But I quickly realized it was so slow to the point it was unusable, when on my phone it&#x27;s working just fine.
 Checking dmesg again the only odd thing I could see if plenty of audit messages for NetworkManager
 I don&#x27;t think this is a firmware issue because it literally went from working fine to not working without me doing any upgrades it touching configuration. I tried restoring a ystem Timeshift snapshot but it also did not help. Does anybody have an idea of where I should look into next?

                              <span>Hi everyone. I have the exact same problem as described in this post https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/2y0o8f/systemctl_suspend_fails/ but I haven&#x27;t been able to find a solution.
 In my desktop computer, running systemctl suspend will shut off the screen and leds for a split second, then the leds light up and fans start spinning but there is no screen output. And now it&#x27;s stuck in this state unless you hard reset.
 Also, I can&#x27;t hibernate the computer.
 Any ideas what might be happening? This didn&#x27;t happen before.

                              <span>I have a dual boot setup with Arch and Windows 10, I have found the Internet speed to be significantly slower on Arch compared to Windows (I have only used Arch for around a week). 
 I have around 25 Mb/s for both downloading and uploading on Windows, whereas on Arch, I can barely top 3 Mb/s. I strolled around the Internet and almost everything I could, i.e
  
Setting regdomain
 Setting DNS in /etc/resolv.conf with systemd-resolved to Google or Cloudfare DNS servers
 Same thing as above but with openresolv
 Setting net.ipv4.tcp_ecn &#x3D; 0 (it was set to 2 by default, it seems to revert every reboot)
 Install linux-firmware, wpa-supplicant,...
 Sorting my mirrors with Reflector 
 Disable power save option (not sure if this worked)
 Checking if I have r8168 network card (no I don&#x27;t)
 Updating my whole system pacman -Syu
  
I have Arch Linux on a Dell Latitude E5540 Laptop, does anyone know what else I could try? :( 
 Thanks beforehand :)

                              <span>I have this problem for some time now and seems that it happens independent from which DE/WM I use. I use fluxbox at this time but this happens also with xfce and cinnamon which I&#x27;ve try. I don&#x27;t have a DM and start via xinit. I&#x27;ve found some similar threads In archlinux&#x27;s forum and I checked and correct .xinitrc as suggested there, but this didn&#x27;t solve the problem. When fluxbox starts(which also have some delay) conky and a pyqt5 application I have in autstart start normally. If I run wezterm it starts without delay also, but firefox, nemo, lutris which I usually run need about 30~40 seconds to start. After this first start, there is no delay if I run them again though. Also if I logout from fluxbox and re-login, then those apps start faster. Any ideas how to fix this?

                              <span>Hello, I am using a TP-Link bluetooth USB dongle to connect with my headphones, and the sounds sometimes skips horribly. The problem seems to be this one and indeed when I run lsusb I see my dongle on the same bus as the other peripherals (keyboard, mouse and a wifi dongle). However all the USB ports available on my PC seem to belong to the same bus (except one USB 2 port which yields even worse sound), so the proposed solution on the wiki doesn&#x27;t work for me. Is there another way to fix this?

                              <span>Using texlab, either with VSCode (through extension) or NeoVim (built-in LSP). Everything works well, except inverse search (ctrl-click in pdf sends you to the line in the TeX document). I have followed the instructions here, for example, for VSCode. Every time I ctrl-click on the pdf in zathura, code with dump core, and there is no inverse lookup. Same thing happens with neovim. What is peculiar is that it is the receiving end (code or neovim) dumps core, so I have no idea what is going on.
 Can anyone confirm whether this is an issue on their end, and/or offer and suggestions? Happy to give more info.

As that performed worse than it should on my laptop I looked at nvtop and saw a flatline graph and nothing but a single Xorg process listed with the gpu.
 What&#x27;s the best way to make sure all steam games run on the GPU? Is there some kind of global X11 setting that can make sure that e.g. fullscreen programs are running on the GPU? Or can I set this on steam?

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m in the progress of making my transition from Windows + WSL to running Arch as my primary OS and I need some help setting up. In Windows I had a workflow which involved opening up a specific file on my Google Drive, reading/editing that file and saving the file. Google Drive sync handled all the syncing between my local copy and Google Drive copy. 
 My question is: How to set this up in Arch?
 I am aware that an official Google Drive client does not exist (although it has been promised by Google). I would rather not switch cloud provider as I am already paying Google for some extra storage. 
 I am aware of Insync, but do not want to pay extra for a client. I would also prefer to have it open source. I have been looking at Rclone, but it seems that two-way sync is not possible (I would be glad to hear if I am wrong though). 
 Preferably I want the sync to be handled automatically. But I am also fine with manually pushing/pulling. Conflicts should be rare and I am fine with manually handling those. 
 Has anyone set this up or has any tips to setting this up? I am not sure where to start. 
 Thanks for the help!

While you probably already know SSDs are faster than traditional HDDs, the different types of drives don’t really explain the differences between interfaces when you’re trying to comparison shop. Breaking down the interfaces and form factors will help you make the right choice.

                              <span>Vim is a powerful command-line code editor tool that’s an enhanced version of the venerable vi editor. Although most people use it with Linux, Vim is compatible with most of the commonly used operating systems, including macOS, Windows, and DOS. 
    
Despite the abundance of graphical rich text editors, familiarity with Vim will help every user, from an experienced system administrator to a newbie programming a Raspberry Pi. However, one important thing to note when using Vim, is that the function of a key depends on the “mode” the editor is in. For example, pressing the alphabet “j” will move the cursor down one line in the “command mode”. You’ll have to switch to the “insert mode” to make the keys input the character they represent.
    
If you’re new to Vim, open a terminal and run vimtutor to get you started with some initial commands before diving into the rest.

                              <span>Your webcam needs to be set up and configured for video calls, so it’s important to test it beforehand, especially the first time you use it. It can be easily tested with the built-in camera app, but if you’re using a third-party video-chatting application, it would be best to test the webcam using that same app. This tutorial shows you how to test your webcam in both situations.

Abbiamo visto perché il chip Apple M1 e i suoi successori sono così veloci e come la storia della Mela sia contraddistinta da rivoluzionari cambi di architettura.Sul versante PC la situazione è più complessa perché, ad esempio, nel caso di Windows il problema principale resta legato alla corretta gestione dell&#x27;emulazione: le prestazioni nell&#x27;esecuzione delle applicazioni Win32 su ARM sono ancora lontane da quelle che si sperimentano con un approccio nativo. A questo proposito, in un altro nostro articolo ci eravamo chiesti cosa farebbero Intel e AMD se il mercato dei PC guardasse ad ARM con ancora maggiore interesse.Per adesso, oltre che sui dispositivi mobili, dove l&#x27;architettura ARM è leader incontrastata, l&#x27;architettura della società britannica di nuovo sulla piazza dopo l&#x27;accordo di acquisizione sfumato con NVidia, in ambito server e data center le quote di mercato sono in continua crescita.

                              <span>Quando si deve inviare un insieme di file ad altri soggetti è buona prassi creare un unico &#x27;contenitore&#x27; che al suo interno ospita tutti gli elementi che si desiderano condividere.L&#x27;espressione zippare una cartella affonda le sue radici nella storia del formato Zip, inizialmente progettato da PKWARE, azienda che nel lontano 1989 presentò l&#x27;utilità PKZIP per l&#x27;archiviazione file e la compressione dei dati.A febbraio dello stesso anno le specifiche del formato Zip furono rilasciate come materiale di pubblico dominio tanto che da allora altre utilità e gli stessi sistemi operativi iniziarono ad abbracciarle.Zippare una cartella significa creare un file compresso in formato Zip che funge da contenitore per tanti file e directory.Alcuni tipi di file possono essere compressi meglio di altri: file di testo, file di immagine in formato BMP, alcune tipologie di database possono spesso essere compressi del 90% o più.</span>

                              <span>Anche se si parla sempre più spesso di connettività FTTH (la fibra ottica arriva fino al router dell&#x27;utente finale) e di FTTC, che comunque rappresenta un&#x27;alternativa in attesa dell&#x27;arrivo delle &#x27;connessioni Gigabit&#x27; (in un altro articolo parliamo della sigla FTTx e delle differenze tra le tipologie di fibra ottica), alcune aree del Paese restano ancora escluse dagli interventi per l&#x27;adeguamento della rete.INWIT è la più grande &#x27;Towerco&#x27; italiana (nello stesso mercato operano Cellnex Telecom, EI Towers e Rai Way) e la seconda in Europa con oltre 22.000 torri gestite.Nata nel 2015 come spin-off del &#x27;ramo tower&#x27; di Telecom Italia, INWIT ha fatto proprie anche le installazioni sul territorio gestite da Vodafone Towers Italia con una fusione (marzo 2020) che ha portato alla creazione di un unico soggetto incaricato della gestione delle torri per la telefonia mobile di TIM e Vodafone.Oggi Open Fiber sigla insieme con INWIT un importante accordo volto alla riduzione del digital divide.</span>

                              <span>Il firmware UEFI è un componente critico per la maggior parte dei dispositivi. Il codice che contiene è responsabile dell&#x27;avvio del dispositivo, prima ancora del caricamento del bootloader e del sistema operativo installato. Per questo con il termine rootkit si fa comunemente riferimento al malware che si attiva prima del caricamento di Windows.Se UEFI viene in qualche modo modificato con l&#x27;aggiunta di codice dannoso quest&#x27;ultimo risulterà caricato prima del sistema operativo. Un aggressore che sfruttasse questa modalità d&#x27;infezione può far passare il codice nocivo completamente inosservato, anche alle soluzioni di sicurezza più evolute.Dal momento che il firmware risiede su un chip separato, gli attacchi informatici contro UEFI sono eccezionalmente sfuggenti e persistenti.</span>

                              <span>Dopo tre anni in cui il prezzo dell&#x27;abbonamento è rimasto inalterato, dal 15 settembre 2022 Amazon si appresta ad applicare un ritocco al rialzo.Negli Stati Uniti il costo di Amazon Prime era già stato recentemente modificato e in Italia Amazon ha cominciato a inviare le prime email agli abbonati annunciando l&#x27;imminente aumento di prezzo.
Quanto costa Amazon Prime dal 15 settembre 2022
 A partire dal prossimo 15 settembre il prezzo dell&#x27;abbonamento annuale ad Amazon Prime passerà da 36 euro a 49,90 euro.Per chi sceglie di pagare l&#x27;abbonamento su base mensile, l&#x27;importo passa dagli attuali 3,99 euro a 4,99 euro.Non tutti sembrano aver ricevuto l&#x27;email di Amazon che informa circa la modifica contrattuale: a coloro che hanno un abbonamento in imminente scadenza la comunicazione non sembra sia stata ancora recapitata.Chi può rinnovare l&#x27;abbonamento annuale entro il 15 settembre prossimo potrà continuare a pagare 36 euro per un altro anno.

Come si vede nell&#x27;esempio in figura, per un abbonamento che scade entro metà settembre prossimo, Amazon chiede sempre un canone annuale di 36 euro.</span>

                              <span>Microsoft ha confermato che l&#x27;aggiornamento KB5014666 per Windows 10 versione 20H2, 21H1, 21H2 e Windows Server 20H2 distribuito a fine giugno scorso sta provocando difficoltà durante l&#x27;utilizzo di alcune stampanti.Alcune stampanti USB non riescono più a stampare e nella finestra Stampanti e scanner risultano presenti copie dei dispositivi di stampa (suffisso Copia1).Mentre i tecnici di Microsoft stanno lavorando per rendere disponibile una patch correttiva, per risolvere il problema viene consigliato di seguire alcuni passaggi:- Digitare Stampanti e scanner nella casella di ricerca di Windows.- Nel caso in cui fossero presenti una o più istanze &#x27;copia&#x27; provare a stampare usando queste ultime.- Se la stampa usando la versione &#x27;copia&#x27; funzionasse correttamente, cliccare sulla stampante Copia1 nella finestra Stampanti e scanner quindi scegliere Proprietà stampante.- Annotare la configurazione impostata nella scheda Porte quindi replicarla nel caso della stampante originale (senza la voce Copia1).- Eliminare la stampante Copia1.Nel caso in cui il problema non venisse risolto e non si riuscisse a usare la stampante USB, il consiglio è quello di verificare la disponibilità di aggiornamenti dei driver sul sito del produttore della stampante.Microsoft consiglia eventualmente di spegnere la stampante, rimuovere i vari riferimenti dalla finestra Stampanti e scanner quindi riavviare il PC.</span>

                              <span>Sulla suite di protocolli TCP/IP basa il suo funzionamento l&#x27;intera rete Internet.Il protocollo IP si occupa di gestire l&#x27;indirizzamento dei nodi e l&#x27;instradamento dei pacchetti dati. A ciascun nodo collegato alla rete Internet viene assegnato un indirizzo IP univoco che lo rende raggiungibile da qualunque altro dispositivo connesso.Così, tipicamente, a meno di configurazioni che prevedano l&#x27;utilizzo della tecnica NAT (Network address translation), il singolo router o il dispositivo mobile nel caso di utilizzo della rete dati dell&#x27;operatore di telefonia mobile risultano assegnatari di un indirizzo IP pubblico dinamico (di solito cambia a ogni nuova connessione) oppure statico (non cambia a ogni collegamento) nei formati IPv4 oppure IPv6.La comunicazione tra due dispositivi collegati alla rete Internet è cosa molto semplice perché è lo stesso protocollo IP, noto l&#x27;indirizzo pubblico del destinatario, a occuparsi della selezione del percorso migliore per veicolare i dati (instradamento).Il port forwarding è una tecnica che permette di trasferire i pacchetti dati da un sistema all&#x27;altro utilizzano una specifica porta di comunicazione.Il già citato TCP e UDP sono protocolli di rete che operano al livello di trasporto: essi si occupano della gestione della procedura di trasferimento dei pacchetti dati utilizzando approcci molto differenti l&#x27;uno rispetto all&#x27;altro.Corre infatti un&#x27;importante differenza tra i protocolli TCP e UDP: il primo è detto connection oriented, il secondo connection-less.</span>

                              <span>Ever since I started to use Arch, 50% of my terminal installs have looked like this:
 -I type in &quot;sudo pacman -S [whatever package I need]&quot;
 -I get asked if I should &quot;Import PGP key [name] [email]?&quot;, I say yes
 -I get an error of this structure:
 error: lib32-glib-networking: signature from &quot;[name] &quot; is unknown trust
 :: File /var/cache/pacman/pkg/lib32-glib-networking-2.70.1-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst is corrupted (invalid or corrupted package (PGP signature)).
 Do you want to delete it? [Y/n]
 No matter what I say here, the packages don&#x27;t install.
 Truth be told, I have absolutely no idea what a keyring is. I have never gotten an error like this in other linux distros. I have tried to search it up on ArchWiki, but as a newbie to all things programming-related, I have absolutely no idea what they&#x27;re talking about.
 Can anyone please explain to me what a keyring is, why it&#x27;s needed for installing packages and how to fix these errors?

                              <span>Hi,
 months ago I have installed arch on my previous laptop&#x27;s ssd and have been using it in an ssd enclosure as an external ssd alongside my laptop which has Windows in its internal ssd. Because my laptop happens to have two ssd slots (one of which is unoccupied) I wanted to take the arch ssd out of the enclosure and into my laptops second ssd slot. My expectation is to use both windows and arch in a dual-boot manner but without the disadvantages of dual-boot (two seperate ssd&#x27;s: lesser chance of things going wrong, not tight on space, etc.). 
 Yesterday I have opened up my laptop for the first time and installed the arch ssd into the empty slot and put the laptop back together. When I start the laptop, I can choose between arch and windows but when I boot arch, the following error occurs: 
 &quot;ERROR: device ‘UUID&#x3D;’ not found. Skipping fsck&quot;
 I know that this error is occuring because the UUID is different now that it is in an ssd slot instead of being connected by USB. So, naturally I have to somehow edit the UUID that the OS searches for when booting. But I just couldn&#x27;t figure out how to and was unsuccessful with finding similar cases in the internet forums. 
 As a result, I&#x27;m here, asking for your help.

But i know im typing in the right password and that its correct, i even followed this tutorial and used the second method. I rebooted and still it just says wrong password.

                              <span>I have 2 seperate animations that I want to play while my PC is starting: one during boot and one just before or just after the display manager login. I have already figured out the boot animation using Plymouth, but I can&#x27;t seem to get the other animation working. Does anybody know how this can be done? I prefer if the animation is played just before the login, however it would also work if it&#x27;s played like a KDE splash screen after login.
 Note: This must work on Arch and it shouldn&#x27;t depend on a specific desktop environment.

                              <span>I am working with a Raspberry Pi Pico micro controller. When it is connected, it is supposed to show up as a mass storage device. It does not do this. 
 It works with picotool when run as root but gives a error otherwise.. Picotool is the software used to connect and upload to them form the command line. 
 The error I get from picotool when it is not root is &quot;Device at bus 1, address 57 appears to be a RP2040 device in BOOTSEL mode, but picotool was unable to connect. Maybe try &#x27;sudo&#x27; or check your permissions.&quot;

 Anyone know how to change the permissions so my non-root account can access it?

 Forgive me if this is a stupid question, I&#x27;m still a bit of a noob.
 Does anyone know why in the Arch repositories, Renpy is still version 7.4.11?
 According to the Renpy page, that version is from December 2, 2021.
 Currently the latest version is 8.0.1 and precisely in this they included new features that I would need for my project.
 Does anyone know something?

 Generating an Arch Linux learning map on the Albera app
 Hi! We&#x27;re Albera, a research engine that aims to save users a bunch of time and effort when trying to learn online.
 Using AI, Albera generates learning roadmaps on any topic (like the one above on Arch Linux), which are then populated with free resources (articles, courses, videos, blog posts, etc), allowing for a structured, efficient, and distraction-free learning experience.
 We&#x27;ve recently launched an iOS app, and we&#x27;re hoping you guys can try it out and share your thoughts with us (using the platform and the app also helps train the AI to provide better results). Thanks!

                              <span>Hello people. I have been using Arch Linux as my main system on my PC for a while now.
 The thing is that I decided to try other distributions on other partitions of my SSD.
 Both Tumbleweed and Fedora could be installed without problems, but they did not recognize the Arch partition in Grub.
 I decided to do a chroot and go back to the Arch Grub, and so I was able to enter my Arch partition, but with a very high boot time.
 I must have done something wrong when chrooting, because before it was booting very fast, with no problems.
 Also, as it didn&#x27;t recognize my Tumbleweed partition in Grub, I decided to reinstall Tumbleweed, and now my Arch partition appears in Grub. I think I simply chose the wrong /boot partition before.
 But the thing is that it still takes a long time to boot Arch.
 After selecting it in Grub, it stays on a black screen with the text on the top left:
 Starting version 251.3-1-arch 
 And then, after a good wait, it brings up the following lines:
 [ TIME ] Timed out waiting for device /dev/disk/by-uuid/31fe4ea4-003c-4c31-947c-88874131ccd3. [DEPEND] Dependency failed for /dev/disk/by-uuid/31fe4ea4-003c-4c31-947c-88874131ccd3.

[DEPEND] Dependency failed for /dev/disk/by-uuid/eBe49236-2233-42c3-8fe4-3a1f7af04b10. 
 Doing systemd-analyze 
 Startup finished in 5.267s (firmware) + 5.226s (loader) + 4.793s (kernel) + 1min 31.668s (userspace) &#x3D; 1min 46.956s graphical.target reached after 1min 31.666s in userspace. 
 As I say, I can get into my ARch partition, in fact I&#x27;m writing this from it, but I think I must have done something wrong to cause this boot time delay.
 Any help would be very welcome.
 Thank you very much.
 Regards, Juan.

 ​
 Backstory: I &quot;tried&quot; arch around christmas 2021 after approximately 9 months of diving into linux headfirst from hackintoshing. It quickly became my daily driver and my linux mint languished. Currently I have fedora 36 spins setup as &quot;just works&quot;. . . I never use it but keep it for now just in case my Arch breaks. At this point I feel like I can just spin up another arch PDQ. . . or use any distro live usb to fix what may be broken. I&#x27;m considering deleting fedora spins and adding it to my mdadm raid home partition.

                              <span>Webcams have experienced a massive rise in use over the last 4 years, thanks to the increase in remote working during the pandemic. But many of us are still conducting business and having meetings over the Internet. To be more ecological, you can use software to create a “webcam” instead of buying another device. In this review we examine Finecam, software which helpfully turns any old iPhones (or new ones for that matter) into handy webcams for your Zoom, Skype, OBS, YouTube or other video calling or live streaming adventures.

                              <span>The rc shell is a simple and innovative command interpreter built for the Plan 9 family of operating systems. It is currently a part of plan9port, which is a suite of Plan 9 software that is available for Linux.
    
Rc aims to improve on the default UNIX shell and it introduces a cleaner syntax for writing scripts. It is also built to be as simple to understand as possible. This makes rc a good program for someone that wants to learn how a shell works.

                              <span>Last week when posting my initial Linux benchmarks of the AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 6850U performance (and also looking at the AMD Rembrandt Windows vs. Linux speed), there were two main areas to get excited about with these AMD Zen 3+ SoCs: nice power efficiency improvements across many real-world workloads and the graphics upgrade with the integrated Radeon 680M. In this article are more tests of the Radoen 680M graphics looking at the integrated graphics speed-up with RDNA2 finally replacing Vega as a big upgrade and also how this compares to the Intel Alder Lake P Xe Graphics performance for Linux laptops.</span>

                              <span>Con un iPhone possiamo ottenere delle belle foto e di fatto rimpiazzare del tutto le fotocamere digitali compatte, visto che il telefono è sempre a portata di mano in tasca o in borsa quindi possiamo scattare subito in pochi secondi.
 L&#x27;unico problema è che le fotografie e le immagini ricevute via chat o via Facebook occupano spazio nella memoria che, prima o poi, si riempie fino ad esaurirsi. Qualsiasi telefono si utilizza, anche fosse il più costoso e con la memoria interna più grande, bisogna sempre scaricare le foto da qualche parte, in modo da poterle conservare al sicuro, liberare la memoria e poterne fare di nuove.
 Nella guida che segue vi mostreremo tutti i metodi per trasferire foto da iPhone a PC utilizzando i metodi di caricamento più comodi ed efficaci (sincronizzazione cloud,…</span>

                              <span>L&#x27;architettura utilizzata per i core ad alte prestazioni dei futuri nuovi processori Intel Raptor Lake (tredicesima generazione) si chiama Raptor Cove.L&#x27;offerta Raptor Lake arriverà sul mercato probabilmente tra settembre e ottobre di quest&#x27;anno anche se il lancio dei nuovi processori avverrà lungo diverse fasi, come già accaduto con le generazioni precedenti. Il processore top di gamma potrebbe essere l&#x27;Intel Core i9-13900K, del quale si parla già da tempo, e i nuovi arrivati nel catalogo Intel avranno il compito di continuare sulla buona strada imboccata con gli Alder Lake raccogliendone l&#x27;eredità.I core ad alta efficienza dei processori Intel Raptor Lake manterranno  invece l&#x27;architettura Gracemont: solo i core più performanti saranno forieri quindi di miglioramenti a livello di IPC.

Nuove &#x27;voci di corridoio&#x27; pongono quasi sullo stesso piano i nuovi core Raptor Cove con gli attuali Golden Cove (architettura dei core ad alte prestazioni usata negli Alder Lake) presentandoli sì come una versione migliorata ma, tutto sommato, come un aggiornamento minore.</span>

Oggi arriva la notizia di un importante accordo.La nuova strategia Intel Device Manufacturing 2.0 (IDM 2.0) comincia a prendere forma con la conferma dell&#x27;intesa tra la società di Santa Clara e MediaTek.I portavoce di MediaTek hanno dichiarato di aver stipulato un accordo per &#x27;costruire una catena di approvvigionamento più equilibrata e resiliente&#x27; che permetta quindi di sostenere tutti i vari prodotti dell&#x27;azienda. Direttamente interessata è quindi la produzione di SoC per dispositivi intelligenti, Chromebook e tablet. Secondo MediaTek le attività di fonderia di Intel dovrebbero migliorare significativamente le capacità espandere le quote di mercato sia negli Stati Uniti che in Europa.La partnership è una vittoria per Intel considerato che MediaTek attualmente si appoggia per la produzione di chip a TSMC.</span>
