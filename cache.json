They work perfectly fine in KDE apps such as panels and Dolphin, and Firefox renders them fine as well. However, Spotify, Discord, and Chromium all do not have font smoothing for these characters and they look ugly.\n Here is a comparison: https://i.imgur.com/xYUDY13.png\n Also, my related post on r/kde on this topic: https://old.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/v8wpuv/why_does_japanese_text_have_smoothing_and_looks/\n I figure if I can fix the fonts in Chromium, they should start working fine in Electron apps too.\n For the record, I have the following fonts installed on the system:\n noto-fonts-cjk\n adobe-source-han-sans-jp-fonts\n adobe-source-han-serif-jp-fonts\n otf-ipafont\n    submitted by    /u/Arnas_Z  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been playing around in NixOS for the last few days and I really like the concept of a config file handling everything that you have on your computer to the point where if you take that one file and install NixOS on another computer with that config file, everything that's on the other computer will be on the new computer. Sort of like duplicating the system.\n Is there a way to do this with Arch (or any other distro for that matter)? I'm sure that feature is built into NixOS but is there a program to install during a basic Arch installation that will use a config file to install all of your needed packages? I know a script will do it but it's kind of neat having a config file that sets up your network, desktop environment, time, etc as well as install all of your programs.\n    submitted by    /u/Phydoux  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Vi sarà certamente capitato, nell'esaminare le specifiche delle unità SSD in commercio, di imbattervi in dati che fotografano una situazione all'apparenza piuttosto strana: le unità a stato solido più capienti sono più veloci rispetto a quelli di dimensione inferiore.I dati non possono certo essere oggetto di discussione perché sono dichiarati dagli stessi produttori e riguardano modelli di SSD appartenenti alla medesima linea di prodotto (differiscono solamente per la rispettiva capienza).Certo, sappiamo bene che i dati pubblicati dai produttori spesso si discostano da quelli rilevati, in situazioni reali, da parte degli utenti. E quando si parla di SSD sono tante le tecnologie che rendono più veloci le unità a stato solido.Ma perché gli SSD sono più lenti se meno capienti?\nCosa significa IOPS\n Prendiamo in esame il valore IOPS nelle operazioni di lettura e scrittura random 4K delle unità SSD.IOPS, innanzi tutto, è acronimo di Input/Output Operations Per Second (si pronuncia eye-ops): si tratta di un valore che esprime il numero di operazioni che l'unità presa in esame è in grado di compiere in un secondo.Il valore di IOPS rilevato può comunque variare sulla base di molteplici fattori: la tipologia di operazioni di lettura e scrittura, il mix di modelli di accesso sequenziale e casuale, il numero di thread, la profondità della coda di lavoro, le dimensioni dei blocchi di dati, la configurazione del sistema, i driver, le operazioni svolte in background dal sistema operativo.Con la specifica IOPS viene data un'idea delle prestazioni di un SSD durante la lettura/scrittura dei dati random 4K posto che le performance di queste unità superano per ordini di grandezza quelle dei tradizionali hard disk magnetomeccanici.In un altro articolo abbiamo descritto le principali differenze tra hard disk e SSD.\nPerché un SSD meno capiente è meno veloce?\n Abbiamo già rilevato come le unità SSD meno capienti siano dichiarate come meno prestazionali rispetto a quelle di maggiori dimensioni.",

L'idea era quella di mettere a punto un sistema che tutti potessero utilizzare, per rendere l'informatica più popolare e proporre un'interfaccia user-friendly.I due riuscirono nell'intento se si considera che il successo commerciale fu enorme per quei tempi con più di 5 milioni di esemplari complessivamente venduti.Il modello originale poggiava il suo funzionamento su una CPU MOS 6502 a 1 MHz, offriva una grafica a colori, con una matrice del testo pari a 40 x 24 caratteri, uscita video composita, interfaccia a cassetta per l'archiviazione e otto slot di espansione interni.Veniva venduto in configurazioni variabili che andavano da 1.298 dollari con una dotazione di 4 KB di RAM a 2.638 dollari per 48 KB di RAM.",
