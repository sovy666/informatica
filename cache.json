          "description": "I did my Arch install a long time ago using Gnome and Xorg I'm trying to switch to wayland. Would this still be the proper way of switching or is this method outdated?\n First, you need to enable NVIDIA kernel modesetting, to do this add the kernel parameter nvidia-drm.modeset=1. Next, ensure that GDM wayland isn't disabled (this isn't strictly necessary since you can launch GNOME from command line). Go to /etc/gdm/custom.conf, and comment out the waylandenable=false line if it is present. Next, you need to edit a udev rule. Edit /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/61-gdm.rules (location might vary based on distro, however its usually there). And comment out the line that mentions disabling wayland if NVIDIA proprietary driver is present. Reboot, you should now be able to use GNOME on Wayland on proprietary NVIDIA driver. And note again that you won't have Xwayland acceleration or it won't work at all, and that there are some NVIDIA eglstreams specific bugs, and that certian functions might have reduced performance compared to GBM. \n    submitted by    /u/Artichoke93  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I use a bluetooth keyboard that I believe to be a Nulea (it is unbranded from AliExpress). Works beautifully, and it very responsive, in general very happy).\n The issue is that in any program where keyboard shortcuts are defined, MOD+CONTROL+{h,j,k,l} doesn't work. Every other combination is fine (MOD+vimkeys, MOD+SHIFT+imkeys, ALT+imkeys, etc). The only combination that doesn't work (and I have tried this in various WMs, vim, sxhkd, etc) is MOD+CONTROL+imkeys.\n When I run xev, those particular keychords are not even recognized. (MOD down and up, good. MOD down + CONTROL down, good. etc. But MOD + CONTROL + {h,j,k,l} show nothing)\n This makes me think that maybe something is running that hold those particular chords in its config? But I have no idea what that could be. I have a pretty minimal Arch running (fewer than 1000 packages installed) as I run most of my development tools in docker containers.\n If someone can offer at least a direction to look, I would really appreciate it.\n    submitted by    /u/thepan73  \n [link]   [comments]",

When i tried to run it my monitors went black with an \"out of range\" message on it and it persists after rebooting. The SDDM animation displays as normal on boot but then when I'd normally get to the KDE desktop i get the black screens again. I was able to hear Firefox start playing a video due to random luck pressing buttons during the black screen, so i'm sure its running I think its just stuck in a display setting that isn't working.\n I've tried editing the kernel parameters and adding nomodeset, also tried specifying the resolution and refresh rate of my monitor there and it doesn't help. I've tried unplugging and plugging the monitors, booting with just one monitor connected, none of it has made a difference. Any suggestions on how to get back to my desktop? I'm using systemdboot and X11 if that makes any difference. Thanks.\n Edit: Finally fixed it. Booted with the kernel parameter 3 in order to boot to the command line and deleted everything in ~/.local/share/kscreen\n Now working after a reboot.\n    submitted by    /u/Mojo_Ryzen  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Intel ha annunciato di aver tagliato un importante traguardo presso il suo stabilimento irlandese (Fab 34): la litografia ultravioletta estrema (EUV) è un processo costruttivo che permette di produrre, a partire dai wafer in silicio, chip sempre più miniaturizzati.Gli scanner litografici rappresentano la parte del processo produttivo che porta a realizzare un processore: stampano la microarchitettura di ogni singolo chip su un wafer di silicio scannerizzando un modello e trasferendone l'immagine sul wafer stesso che viene poi sviluppato. Sebbene gli scanner litografici facciano parte del processo produttivo dei chip da diversi anni, la più recente versione della tecnologia, EUV, consente di stampare i circuiti in dimensioni più ridotte e con una maggiore precisione.Azienda leader nella produzione di macchinari per l'utilizzo della soluzione EUV è l'olandese ASML, spesso tirata in ballo anche di recente quando si è parlato di Chips Act e degli sforzi europei per spostare una buona parte della produzione di chip nel vecchio continente entro il 2030.\n\nLo specifico sistema EUV prodotto da ASML e installato presso l'impianto Fab 34 di Intel in Irlanda è probabilmente il più complesso macchinario mai costruito: è composto da 100.000 parti, 3.000 cavi, 40.000 bulloni e più di un chilometro e mezzo di tubi.",

Talvolta, soprattutto quando non ci si accorge che la stampante è offline, tendono a formarsi importanti code di stampa sulle varie workstation.In alcuni casi risulta necessario eliminare la coda di stampa perché i documenti che si desiderano stampare restano perennemente in attesa di essere presi in carico.Cancellare la coda di stampa bloccata è utile sia per chi utilizza una stampante locale, collegata al PC in uso, sia chi fa uso di una stampante di rete connessa al router via cavo Ethernet o WiFi. Talvolta la stampante può essere condivisa da altri PC usando le funzioni integrate in Windows, macOS e Linux oppure mediante l'utilizzo di un print server. Alcuni router dotati di porte USB integrano tale funzionalità.Quando la stampante non stampa è bene prendere in esame tutte le possibile problematiche che possono impedire il corretto invio di documenti alla stampante.Per eliminare la coda di stampa e sbloccare la stampante è necessario intervenire sullo spooler di stampa: si tratta di un componente software che agisce come una memoria buffer per i dati diretti alla stampante.",
