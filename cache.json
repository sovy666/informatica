          "description": "Gli elementi attivi che vengono caricati dalle varie pagine Web sono responsabili di buona parte del consumo energetico di un dispositivo portatile, soprattutto se il sistema viene prevalentemente usato per la navigazione online.Google sta provando una nuova funzionalità nel suo browser Chrome che ha come obiettivo quello di ridurre i consumi ed estendere l'autonomia della batteria.Chiamata Quick Intensive Throttling after loading, la nuova caratteristica si occupa di disattivare il codice JavaScript che resta in esecuzione in background.Di norma, infatti, per le pagine Web gestite in background Chrome disattiva il codice JavaScript presente dopo 5 minuti dal caricamento iniziale.Con la nuova funzionalità, Chrome 'neutralizza' JavaScript dopo appena 10 secondi andando così a migliorare significativamente la durata della batteria.La riattivazione del codice JavaScript viene permessa per una sola volta ogni minuto, se e solo se una scheda del browser non è stata utilizzata per almeno 5 minuti.I tecnici di Google spiegano che l'esperimento appena varato ha permesso di ridurre significativamente l'occupazione della CPU da parte di Chrome (circa il 10% in meno).La novità risulta al momento attivabile su richiesta dell'utente nelle versioni Dev e Canary di Chrome digitando nella barra degli indirizzi chrome://flags/#quick-intensive-throttling-after-loading e attivando l'impostazione corrispondente.Google precisa di non aver rilevato alcun problema nel corso dei test interni lasciando intendere che Quick Intensive Throttling after loading è destinata a debuttare anche nella versione stabile del browser, prima sotto forma di Chrome flag e poi come opzione accessibile attraverso le impostazioni.L'opzione chrome://flags/#quick-intensive-throttling-after-loading è disponibile in tutte le versioni di Chrome, su qualunque piattaforma, da quelle per i sistemi desktop a quelle per i dispositivi mobili..",

VBA è un'implementazione di Visual Basic inserita all'interno di applicazioni Microsoft come appunto la suite Office che è stata progettata negli anni '80.Dal momento che il codice VBA permette di eseguire un ampio ventaglio di operazioni sul sistema in uso, le macro sono da tempo sfruttate come trampolino di lancio per la diffusione di molteplici tipologie di minacce informatiche.Quando si riceve un documento via email o lo si scarica da Internet questo viene aperto in Office nella modalità chiamata Visualizzazione protetta: il caricamento delle macro eventualmente presenti viene automaticamente disabilitato e il file è gestito in sola lettura.",

Il sistema di controllo monitora costantemente le temperature di lavoro e combina effetti luminosi RGB con un buzzer integrato per informare l'utente circa un'eventuale situazione di pericolo.Quando tutto funziona correttamente i moduli di memoria si illuminano di verde mentre quando viene rilevato un problema si colorano di blu e rosso. L'emissione di segnali acustici permette di attirare l'attenzione dell'utente.La particolarità della soluzione di TeamGroup è che i moduli DDR5 ospitano 'in hardware' il sistema di controllo delle temperature e tutta la parte di segnalazione visiva e sonora.A sottolineare che al momento queste memorie sono progettate per l'utilizzo in ambienti industriali, si sa già che esse saranno disponibili nei formati U-DIMM, SO-DIMM, ECC-DIMM e R-DIMM.",
