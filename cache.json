          "description": "I should preface this by saying that I'm still pretty new to all this, and feeling somewhat overwhelmed by what is a pretty big black box to me.\n Up until just recently, my laptop's cpu temperature was running up to the mid 60s on idle and I'm not entirely sure why. I've done powertop --auto-tune as outlined in the wiki and it somehow managed to make the temperature worse (over 70C), which I can assume leads to a worse battery life.\n On top of all this, the temperature control seems to sometimes work well on power supply. The fan kicks on around 55C and runs until the temperature hits 50C, which I think is pretty ideal (similar to what I'm seeing on Windows at least). That only appears to be true on power supply though, because when I just unplugged it, the temperature shot up to 65C and remains there. I'm not hearing the fan speed up to compensate the rising temperature either.\n The power drain is still horrible.\n I assume there is some information I can provide that would help diagnose whatever is going on here. Please let me know what that is.\n At the very least, I can tell you some system info:\n OS: Arch Linux x86_64\n Host: XENIA 15 M37957-404\n Kernel: 5.17.4-arch1-1\n CPU: 11th Gen Intel i7-11800H (16) @ 4.600GHz\n GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Mobile / Max-Q \n GPU: Intel TigerLake-H GT1 [UHD Graphics]\n Right now I'm on the Intel GPU.\n Edit: Okay, so I thought about it makes sense that the fan is less aggressive on battery. The heat produced by the cpu is still there; the fan just pushes it elsewhere. In other words, it's sucking power either way. Saying that, the underlying issue is to figure out what's turned on that doesn't need to be, maybe?\n Thank you for any advice anyone can offer. I'm incredibly confused.\n    submitted by    /u/-_H_-_E_-_L_-_P_-  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have mounted this partition to /mnt/efi, then installed base linux-firmware and linux packages with pacstrap. Now I ls efi folder, but do not see any new files there. Did I did something wrong or I need to create efi files manually somehow? Would appreciate your help!\n    submitted by    /u/normaneye  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This weekend I installed arch linux. first time installing with tty, happy that it works other than the fps issues, I did try a few things. \n my laptop specs are 9300h, nvidia 1650 M and integrated graphics so it comes with optimus.\n I installed nvidia, nvidia-utils, nvidia-settings and nvidia-prime for drivers and for gui, I got xorg, xorg-xinit and qtile then went on .xinitrc and added exec qtile start and nothing else basically with regards to drivers or display server, I just ran startx after login every time I use my laptop, I plan to use login manager later\n For the 2 games I play, both of which have native linux support. I do prime-run osu-lazer or use prime-run launch options in csgo\n thing is the fps is way lower than expected, my friend with the same hardware gets 2000 to 2500 fps on osu-lazer and gets 220-250 fps in csgo, while I get 200 to 400 for osu-lazer and 30-60 on csgo. he uses pop_os! which has it's own optimus manager built in.\n he does have an external monitor BUT his fps is the same with laptop monitor or external monitor. \n so I did the obvious thing and tried the optimus manager, from the aur, \n I did optimus-manger --switch nvidia but got an error with \"latest gpu setup attempt failed at xorg pre-start hook\" \n searching online running prime-offload command before switching using optimus manager helps, which actually worked and I ran the optimus-manager --switch nvidia command without errors but this led to me having even lower fps than prime-run for osu-lazer and I didn't test this for csgo. \n I thought before I try the other options in arch wiki for optimus systems, there must be something I am doing wrong for my situation and wanted help. \n if I can't fix this I am considering dual booting pop_os! along arch.\n    submitted by    /u/Incalculas  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Con la tecnica HDR (high dynamic range) è possibile migliorare la 'qualità dei pixel' permettendo di godere di immagini molto più realistiche e maggiormente aderenti alla realtà. HDR consente di avere immagini con una più ricca gamma di colori, bianchi più luminosi e neri più profondi.Abbiamo visto cos'è e come funziona HDR parlando anche delle differenze tra monitor HDR10, HDR10+ e Dolby Vision descrivendone le principali differenze.Per attivare HDR in Windows e la modalità Auto HDR, pensata per ottimizzare la resa dei contenuti SDR o a 'intervallo dinamico standard' basta agire sulle impostazioni del monitor. Abbiamo già visto come migliorare la resa del monitor o del display in Windows.Per apprezzare le migliorie introdotte nella resa delle immagini con HDR è possibile servirsi della funzione nascosta Split screen presentata da Microsoft e disponibile per tutti gli utenti avanzati.Basta aprire il prompt dei comandi con i diritti amministrativi e digitare:reg add HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\GraphicsDrivers /v AutoHDR.ScreenSplit /t REG_DWORD /d 1Per disattivare la modalità Split screen basta usare il comando che segue:reg delete HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\GraphicsDrivers /v AutoHDR.ScreenSplit /fLa novità riservata agli utenti di Windows 11 è che adesso, premendo Windows+G, facendo clic sull'icona dell'ingranaggio in alto, scegliendo Funzionalità di gioco e infine Modifica intensità HDR si può agire su una barra che aiuta a definire quanto i colori debbano essere più o meno vividi.La novità arriverà attraverso un aggiornamento della Xbox Game Bar distribuito attraverso il Microsoft Store.Gli utenti di Windows 11 potranno inoltre beneficiare presto del supporto multi-GPU per più schede video dedicate in configurazione Nvidia Scalable Link Interface (SLI) e AMD CrossFire.Maggiori informazioni sono reperibili nell'annuncio pubblicato da Microsoft..",
