          "description": "I've been having the worst case of microphone noise. My recorded audio would include a consistent high-pitched static sound that I find best described as \"whine\" (kinda like coil whine). I suspect it's got something to do with my particular motherboard but I have no idea. Plugging in different mics in different places did nothing to help the issue and I would hear it the same with no mic plugged in.\n The solution is to use a package called noise-suppression-for-voice. It uses the same neural net technology as rnnoise which is used by OBS studio. My best results have been achieved by using this along with the echo cancel module. After installing the above package, you want to add the following lines to your default.pa config file (mine is in .config/pulse/default.pa):\n # Create echo cancel source # module-echo-cancel will automatically cancel from the current default source load-module module-echo-cancel source_name=echo_cancel_source # Create denoised mic device load-module module-null-sink sink_name=denoised_mic_sink rate=48000 sink_properties='device.description=\"Denoised Mic\"' load-module module-ladspa-sink sink_name=mic_sink sink_master=denoised_mic_sink label=noise_suppressor_stereo plugin=/usr/lib/ladspa/librnnoise_ladspa.so control=50 sink_properties='device.description=\"Noise Suppressor\"' load-module module-loopback source=echo_cancel_source sink=mic_sink channels=2 source_dont_move=true sink_dont_move=true latency_msec=1 # Set as default source set-default-source denoised_mic_sink.monitor \n    submitted by    /u/sk8r_dude  \n [link]   [comments]",

I tried fixing it by updating archlinux-keyring, but that doesn't work. Is there an easy fix for this? I searched half of the internet to find a solution, and nothing worked.\n Secondly, sometimes it doesn't have the problem with the pgp signature but rather not enough disk space. I mounted the root partition to /mnt and the EFI partition to /mnt/EFI. The root partition is 455 gib in size. My theory is, that it tries to download the packages to my install stick, which is only 16gib.

I mostly use Gnome so I didn't notice it before but recently when I switched to a tiling window manager I observed a wierd issue, in gnome scrolling through text is smooth in text editors namely Neovim, Emacs and VS Code however when I installed awesome wm continuous scrolling through text either vertically or horizontally was slow or laggy even in terminal even though everything else was so snappy. At first I thought it was due to Wayland but then I tested sway and hyprland and they had the same issue infact other desktop environments beside Gnome namely KDE Plasma and Xfce both had the same issue. In Gnome text scrolling is smooth even on Xorg so its not related to wayland. I haven't tested any other distro since Arch Linux is my favourite so I am not sure if this issue is exclusive to Arch or is same in other distros as well.\n    submitted by    /u/shans10  \n [link]   [comments]",

From what I've read around I think it has to do with politi, but I'm not sure. \n How can I solve it in your opinion? \n A thousand thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/oscarmonteleone  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, my laptop (also Arch) is able to download at full speed via pacman.\n Recently, I've also been experiencing this:\n error: failed retrieving file 'qt5-translations-5.15.5+kde+r2-1-any.pkg.tar.zst.sig' from archlinux.thaller.ws : Operation too slow. Less than 1 bytes/sec transferred the last 10 seconds\n I attempted to run Reflector to fix the mirrors, which worked on my laptop but not on the desktop.

I nodi coinvolti in una comunicazione non hanno visibilità su ciò che avviene sugli altri nodi e i dati scambiati dall'utente con i server remoti sono crittografati a più livelli con uno schema che ricorda la struttura di una cipolla (da qui il nome onion router).Tor Browser 11.5 integra un meccanismo espressamente progettato per superare ogni censura.",

Per quali caratteristiche un servizio brilla rispetto al concorrente?\nSincronizzazione\n La velocità di trasferimento dati è importante: poter aggiornare velocemente file di grandi dimensioni che sono stati caricati sul cloud è un aspetto cruciale.A questo proposito OneDrive utilizza una tecnologia chiamata Block Level Copying: la soluzione per lo storage cloud scompone i file, soprattutto quelli di grandi dimensioni, in frammenti più piccoli e compatti. In questo modo, invece che caricare online un unico pesante file, OneDrive si limita a effettuare l'upload dei frammenti essenziali.",

Touchscreen support is now built in to the Linux kernel, so theoretically, any Linux distribution should be able to run with a touchscreen. That said, not every distribution will be easy to use on a touchscreen, and this comes down to the desktop environment each one works best with. You may have to choose the best Linux distros for a touchscreen that use the optimal desktop out of the box.\n    \nFor example, using a tiling window manager like Awesome or i3 isn’t going to do you much good on a touchscreen without some heavy tweaking. Choose the right desktop environment, and you’ll have a much better time using Linux on this type of hardware.\n   \n\nContent\n\n1. GNOME\n2. KDE Plasma\n3. Cinnamon\n4. Deepin DE\n5.
