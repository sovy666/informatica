          "description": "I'm setting up Arch for the first time and I'm doing everything in i3 if that helps at all. I don't have any audio however. I went to try and turn on some lofi while I work on setting up and getting surf installed (if anyone can give me pointers on that as well, I'd be appreciative). But I don't have any audio and I've tried updating pulseaudio, installing and updating pulseaudio-alsa, and made sure my keybindings for volume keys are correct. I still haven't had any luck so I'm hoping someone that's better experienced at Arch could give me some pointers. \n Thank you!\n Quick edit: I skimmed some other posts and updating pulseaudio and pulseaudio-alsa were some of the fixes I've found, but they didn't work for me.\n    submitted by    /u/Abstract_9  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now that is done, there are two questions I was hoping I could get answers for:\n  \nOnce I have it installed, are there any tasks I must do? I’ve seen the ‘General Recommendations’ page on the wiki, but am not sure if that’s something that is optional. Am I good to just start installing apps, or do I need to do some additional configuration first, such as securing my system?\n \nIs there any way I could backup my system? Considering how new I am to this I know I’m probably going to break something eventually, and would rather not have to start from scratch each time. On a VM I know I could just take snapshots, but I am not sure how to do something like that outside a VM.\n \nOn installing AUR packages, I’ve read that I am supposed to manually check the package build (?). Is this what I’m supposed to be checking? If so, what should I be looking for yo make sure it is safe.\n \n Thanks!\n Edit: Added another question\n    submitted by    /u/FreeBeachFortune  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "First of all, let me explain how I got here: \n When installing arch, I used the archinstall utility and when asked about partitioning I selected \"Best effort partition layout\", which lead the utility to create two partitions (apart from boot and efi): \"Filesystem Root\" and \"Home\". Home contains just my home folder and Filesystem Root contains everything else. After using arch for about 3 months (where I am now) the Filesystem Root has filled up, so I tried merging the two partitions: \n First I made a live usb with EndeavourOS (I picked this distro at random, but I don't think it matters) and booted off of it, then I resized the Home partition to be 80GB instead of 150GB and resized the Root partition to be 100GB instead of 35GB. \n After a reboot to check if I didn't screw up already (everything was fine) I went to the live usb again and copied my user home folder to the root partition, after this I rebooted: \n Where I am now\n ​\n I can't login into my user (gnome 42.1 with gdm) when using Xorg, but when using Wayland I can login and find that almost no apps open (I think I broke flatpak apps) and when launching apps from terminal they say Authorization required, but no authorization protocol specified. \n I am stuck at this strange error message now, although I have a backup of the home folder since I copied it instead of moving it. \n Sorry for any english mistakes, it's not my primary language.

          "description": "I've bought a brand new Dell XPS 15 9520 laptop (should be a 2022 model). My usual Linux setup involves enabling secure boot with custom keys, and using full-disk encryption with automatic unlock based on TPM. Since the laptop came with Windows preinstalled, it came with secure boot enabled and with Microsoft's keys installed.\n The first thing I tried was putting the UEFI in \"Expert Key Management\" mode to clear the current keys and allow me to enroll my own, but I was greeted with the below warning:\n  \nModifying Secure Boot Databases could renter your system unable to boot. System graphics may not function. Some devices might not function properly. The system could become unrecoverable.\n  \nThis is in the same lines to the warning in the Arch Wiki. I've also read similar reports in the past from people around Reddit. It's also not very clear on just what exactly it means by \"may not function\". Note that the laptop comes with an integrated intel video card and a dedicated nvidia one.\n Does anybody have experience in enrolling custom keys in their recent Dell laptops? I had no trouble at all enrolling custom keys into my 3-years old Dell Precision 5540, but that laptop had an obviously older UEFI app and a different general build.\n I don't dare to clear the current keys until I find confirmation online that it's safe to do so (I wish Dell included a clearer message).\n ​\n EDIT: here are some pictures on what the UEFI screen shows exactly. Note the warnings in the \"Enable Microsoft UEFI CA\" section as well.\n    submitted by    /u/zayatura  \n [link]   [comments]",

In termini di gravità, entrambe sono valutate con un punteggio di 9,8 su un massimo di 10 e possono essere sfruttate per aggredire reti aziendali, attivare backdoor, botnet e altre forme di malware.Il 6 aprile scorso VMware ha rivelato e corretto una vulnerabilità legata all'esecuzione di codice in modalità remota (CVE-2022-22954) e un bug che può facilitare l'acquisizione di privilegi più elevati (CVE-2022-22960).Stando a quanto conferma CISA, gli aggressori sono stati in grado di effettuare il reverse engineering delle patch ufficiali VMware in sole 48 ore iniziando rapidamente a sfruttare le vulnerabilità.Secondo i report condivisi da alcune tra le principali aziende che offrono strumenti per la sicurezza informatica, gli attaccanti sono in grado di concatenare le vulnerabilità di VMware per causare danni e sottrarre dati riservati.Nel caso di un'azienda attaccata intorno a metà aprile con un'iniziativa mirata, gli utenti malintenzionati hanno prima sfruttato CVE-2022-22954 per eseguire un comando shell arbitrario come utente VMware.",
