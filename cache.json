But if I'm connected to ANYTHING else but my home wifi, it will take a quite concerning amount of time. And I'm not talking about internet speed! I was connected to wifis with over 500Mbit/s download AND upload and still, establishing connections takes forever. The task of going to speedtest.net, clicking the button and waiting until the download is being tested can sometimes take more than a minute, sometimes failes entirely. But when it succeedes, it will show the correct internet speed of the respective network, eg. 500 Mbit/s up and down. Even pings take forever.\n To get a grasp of how painful this is in my daily life, take a look at this demo. First I'm connected to my home network. Then I switch to my hotspot from my phone. I'm using plain wpa_supplicant (was using NetworkManager before, same problem) and my home wifi isn't configured in some weird way.\n https://youtu.be/4oooGGRnLzU\n ​\n So yeah, do you have any ideas how solve this issue?\n ​\n Edit: I might add some additional information about my system:\n  \nArch Linux on a 82LM IdeaPad 5\n wpa_supplicant v2.10\n Router: FRITZ!Box 7490\n Home Wifi fast on both 5 and 2.4 GHz (latter using a repeater)\n ISP is o2 for DSL internet and also o2 for my mobile service.

          "description": "I have numerous issues with Cinnamon after updates over the last few months. The main ones being that some of my apps won't display properly; such as Steam, when i go to launch steam via the cinnamon menu, it starts a fully black box where the steam window should be. Thus, I can only start steam in the terminal to actually see/use it - strange since it references the same command. I also am unable to change some of the themes (namely the icon theme or the mouse pointer theme). I have tried a few things now, but it's just really getting on my nerves. I'm assuming that if I can just wipe cinnamon off and re-install it fresh, I'm hoping it will just resolve all the problems I've got. I'm not sure what impact or problems I might create doing this on my main PC, so I wanted to ask advice on how to best do this without making myself more headaches afterwards. I tried just removing it via the usual command below, but after I re-install cinnamon, it simply restored my previous settings/problems (I'm assuming it keeps the config files, maybe do I need Rsc? I am a little worried on running the -c option if so).\n $sudo pacman -Rns cinnamon $sudo pacman -S cinnamon \n FYI I start my PC, and launch X via typing $ startx, and my xinitrc file simply just has the exec set to the below. So I should be ok to do this before running startx.\n exec cinnamon-session \n    submitted by    /u/sg4rb0sss  \n [link]   [comments]",

But at some point I migrated my work to a separate, dedicated Debian laptop, and now my main rig is back to being my personal system again. Now I wonder if I should just ditch the dual-boot and go back to using full dedicated Arch (I did in the past but with derivatives like Manjaro and Antergos - when it was still alive that is).\n After I got a better grasp on how dependencies and software development are tied together (partly thanks to work, partly due to Valve embracing Arch as a base for their work - which gave me further insights on how to essentially not be tied to specific distros, or TL;DR…",

          "description": "A fine 2020 erano stati portati al debutto i messaggi effimeri in WhatsApp: si tratta di una funzione che provvede a cancellare chat e allegati dopo il loro invio una volta superata la finestra temporale specificata dall'utente.Dopo le critiche iniziali, gli sviluppatori di WhatsApp hanno fatto in modo di poter impostare la durata dei messaggi effimeri a 24 ore, 7 giorni oppure 90 giorni.\n\nPer attivare le chat temporanee in WhatsApp basta toccare sul nome dell'utente o del gruppo quindi scorrere la schermata fino a individuare Messaggi effimeri.Purtroppo la scelta tecnica di WhatsApp è lontana anni luce da quella implementata in Telegram che permette di impostare liberamente un timer di autodistruzione dei messaggi bloccando di default anche l'inoltro delle conversazioni e la creazione di screenshot, cosa che invece su WhatsApp si può fare.E c'è un aspetto del quale in tanti non si erano accorti: gli allegati come le foto e i video inviati e ricevuti all'interno di una chat temporanea, quindi trattati come messaggi effimeri, venivano rimossi soltanto all'interno delle conversazioni ma continuavano a restare nella galleria del dispositivo mobile.Un imminente aggiornamento WhatsApp sta per modificare questo comportamento facendo sì che i file inviati come allegati in una chat temporanea (messaggi effimeri) non vengano più salvati nella galleria fotografica.Gli utenti che lo vorranno, tuttavia, avranno la facoltà di continuare a memorizzare nella galleria locale tutti i file e i video, compresi quelli inviati nelle conversazioni temporanee..",

          "description": "Parlando di migliori processori Intel e AMD abbiamo visto come la società guidata da Lisa Su abbia da tempo convintamente investito sull'architettura multichip (MCM) allontanandosi dallo schema monolitico ancora scelto in casa Intel.AMD rafforzerà la sua offerta di processori EPYC destinati ai server: la gamma 7004 (nome in codice Genoa) utilizzerà il nuovo socket SP5 LGA-6096 ma soprattutto introdurrà varianti che punteranno molto sull'aspetto della potenza.La società di Sunnyvale ha presentato processori EPYC con 8 chiplet per un massimo di 64 core a livello di CPU ma la nuova generazione sarà disponibile in una versione a 12 chiplet per un totale di ben 96 core fisici e 192 thread. L'immagine sottostante (fonte: AMD TF Malaysia) è più eloquente di tante parole.\n\nIl risultato è stato ottenuto riducendo le dimensioni dei chip grazie all'adozione del processo litografico a 5 nm di TSMC, alla nuova architettura Zen 4 dei core e a un processo di incapsulamento che di fatto consente di usare i chiplet senza soluzione di continuità.AMD rilascerà versioni dotate di alcuni core disabilitati: un processore con 12 chiplet non è detto che abbia tutti i 96 core attivi.Ogni die CCD Zen4 ha un'area di 72 mm2, ridotta di 8 mm2 rispetto agli EPYC Milan realizzati con l'architettura Zen 3.Anche il die I/O è più piccolo, circa 397 mm2 rispetto ai 416 mm2 delle CPU EPYC di precedente generazione.La nuova piattaforma SP5 di AMD supporterà fino a 12 canali di memoria DDR5 e l'interfaccia PCIe Gen5.AMD sta già fornendo i primi chip Genoa ai suoi clienti con l'intera serie EPYC 7004 che verrà lanciata entro la fine di quest'anno..",

          "description": "Windows 11 presto integrerà una funzione che attacca alla radice una delle peggiori e più comuni abitudini di molti utenti. Di cosa stiamo parlando? Della memorizzazione delle password in comuni file di testo, ad esempio file TXT o DOCX salvati in locale.Annotare le credenziali di accesso in un semplice file è assolutamente insicuro: in primis perché non essendo in alcun modo protetto il contenuto di tale file può cadere preda di malintenzionati e componenti malware. Per secondo perché se il sistema non è protetto ad esempio con soluzioni quali BitLocker o VeraCrypt, che cifrano tutto il contenuto del disco, avviando la macchina da un supporto di boot tutti i file in essa contenuti possono essere facilmente sottratti. Ne abbiamo parlato negli articoli dedicati a come accedere a Windows 10 senza password e come fare in caso di password Windows 11 dimenticata.Tramite un aggiornamento della tecnologia SmartScreen, Windows 11 22H2 avvertirà l'utente non appena proverà a inserire una password in un software considerato potenzialmente non sicuro.",
