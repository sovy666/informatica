It works perfectly and you probably forget about these files.\n But years later these old configurations may break newest package versions and problems may begin.\n Also sometimes I find config files which probably were part of a package but now are orphaned. May be I'm wrong but that should not happen.\n The concept of pacnew files is not that optimal in my opinion.\n Because Arch Linux is quite flexible, there should be a nice solution to modify my favourite distribution without changing it.\n…",

I also use a usb switch to share my keyboard/mouse with my laptop (which has arch) and my desktop. Additionally, I run my laptop in clamshell mode (laptop lid is closed while output goes to an external monitor).\n I've noticed that if I let the laptop idle long enough to turn off the external monitor, then switch my usb switch to my desktop, then switch back, the computer will suspend a few seconds after un-idling. I looked in the journal, and basically as soon as the usb switch reconnected systemd-logind suspends the computer. I was just wondering what exactly the issue is here, because it's rather annoying having to open the laptop lid to wake up the computer after being on my desktop for a little while.\n If more information is needed, I can provide it. I'm kinda new to arch, so I've provided what I thought was relevant.\n Recently, oddly enough, this pattern has seemed to stop, and I'm not sure why.

Steam built-in fps counter shows 60, but the game stutters so much it looks like 20 or less frames. It's like freezing for .x of a second every frame. I tried running it natively and through Proton, works the same. I can't really test it on Windows, because I'm not dual-booting. \n I'm updating everything through pacman almost daily (-Syu), so there's no way I have obsolete drivers. \n I really don't know what more I can do. \n I have 1x8GB RAM, swap file of 8GB, running it with gamemode and turbo boost (Intel CPU) on without any unnecessary programs in the background (Discord, Spotify, etc.). Of course the CPU governor is set to performance and I'm playing with AC plugged in. I allocated the most RAM to the iGPU the BIOS let me (512MB). \n I even found some launch options for Terraria on Steam and nothing seemed to work.\n Of course I tried lowering the settings in game, even to the lowest, and nothing changed. I lowered the resolution too, but it looks shitty even on 1600x900 and I wasn't able to move the cursor to the edge of my screen (the cursor space was 1600x900 even though the game was still rendering in fullscreen?).\n Help please, I don't want to play the mobile port:(\n    submitted by    /u/palgume123  \n [link]   [comments]",

Furthermore, I added another hook for nvidia-lts to pacman and reinstalled optimus-manager (to be on the safe side). To check whether my system complains I removed nvidia, optimus-manager is set to always start with nvidia atm. So far the transition seem to have run smoothly. Problem is the freezing remains.

          "description": "Microsoft lo stava sviluppando ormai da più di un anno: conosciuto con il nome in codice di Project Monarch, si tratta di un client di posta elettronica per Windows che raccoglierà l'eredità di Outlook, disponibile in molteplici versioni.L'obiettivo del nuovo One Outlook è quello di presentare agli utenti un'applicazione che funziona nello stesso identico modo su qualunque dispositivo venga usata. Quasi sicuramente dovrebbe soppiantare le tradizionali applicazioni Posta e Calendario integrate in Windows.Durante le fasi di sviluppo di Project Monarch Microsoft ha preferito non mostrare alcuna anteprima e continuare a sviluppare internamente il nuovo Outlook.Il design complessivo riflette quello della versione Web di Outlook, al momento non sembra supportare account utente Microsoft di tipo personale (ma la cosa cambierà di sicuro da qui al momento del rilascio ufficiale) e non sembrano essere previsti particolari add-on.La novità più evidente a colpo d'occhio è che le principali funzioni dell'applicazione sono state posizionate nella parte superiore della finestra, a destra.\n\nLe email si aprono invece in una finestra dedicata, similmente a quanto avviene oggi.",

          "description": "Siamo abituati ad acquistare unità SSD che, come tutti i dispositivi di memorizzazione, non sono 'immortali' e che con il tempo possono presentare problemi.Ci siamo chiesti in passato se la durata degli SSD sia un parametro di cui preoccuparsi sottolineando che le temperature di lavoro e il tempo hanno oggi un impatto negativo sul ciclo di vita di un dispositivo basato su memoria flash piuttosto che il numero di scritture.Parlando sempre di unità a stato solido, a febbraio 2022 un ricercatore aveva riportato in auge il problema della perdita di dati da alcuni modelli di SSD in seguito a un'improvvisa interruzione dell'alimentazione.Adesso Verbatim lancia l'idea dell'unità SSD scrivibile una volta sola: presentato come un dispositivo 'a lunga durata', SWOVA128G ha una capacità di 128 GB, utilizza storage flash NAND, interfaccia USB 3.2 Gen 1 e offre una garanzia di ben 10 anni (quando l'unità è utilizzata in ambienti a 55°C o meno).L'obiettivo è impedire la cancellazione accidentale dei dati: Verbatim SWOVA128G, infatti, accetta esclusivamente la memorizzazione di nuovi dati previa installazione su PC di un apposito software (compatibile con Windows 10 e Windows 11) ma in ogni caso non permette di eliminare quelli già scritti.La scrittura dei dati è consentita solamente da Windows 10 e 11 mentre tutti gli altri sistemi operativi compatibili con il file system exFAT (compresi macOS, Android, iOS,...) possono solo limitarsi a leggere e copiare i dati conservati nell'SSD.Il dispositivo di storage firmato Verbatim può essere un po’ considerato come l'evoluzione dei tradizionali DVD: nel caso di SWOVA128G, però, la 'sessione' resta sempre aperta nel senso che gli utenti autorizzati possono comunque aggiungere nuovi file e cartelle fino all'eventuale raggiungimento della capienza massima.In termini di dimensioni l'SSD è compatto: misura appena 46 x 108 x 9,5 mm e pesa 55 grammi.",
