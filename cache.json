          "description": "After quite a long evening, we finally managed to package the new nvidia-open drivers. They are now in [testing] and I'd like for some extra opinions with these drivers as they are quite experimental. I packaged them to the best of my knowledge but again, they might be unusable for most purposes. Those with compatible hardware (fairly recent hardware) can install the package and give it a spin. Keep in mind that they are at the moment severely limited as opposed to the blob drivers.\n Take special note of the post install note:\n  \nIn order to boot this on non-datacenter cards, you currently need to set NVreg_OpenRmEnableUnsupportedGpus=1 during module load You can try it like this: modprobe nvidia NVreg_OpenRmEnableUnsupportedGpus=1 but you should likely set it in a /etc/modprobe.d file to make it permanent.\n  \nI'd like to collect some feedback directly in this thread.\n    submitted by    /u/Svenstaro  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I hope I don't get too much hate from this community, but this is just to understand and get the feedback of our community! Thanks.\n One of the negative points towards Windows that makes me very angry is the fact that it is constantly updating and needing to be restarted. I switched to Linux also to overcome this need, however, I notice that it is also recommended to constantly update in Arch Linux, so finally the user experience in this regard is more or less the same.\n I believe there are other distros without this need, but I am really enjoying using Arch and learning from it and from this community.\n tldr; What is your opinion about the recommended updates in Arch, any advice to keep the system sort of up-to-date but without the need to update every now and then? Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/100is99plus1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Al crescere delle minacce informatiche è diventato sempre più indispensabile adottare strumenti di sicurezza per la protezione dei propri dati. Il nome utente e la password sono dati insufficienti a garantire elevati standard di sicurezza perché sono facili da sottrarre e possono essere utilizzati da soggetti non autorizzati. Ne abbiamo parlato anche in occasione del World Password Day.Molte applicazioni online chiedono oggi agli utenti di aggiungere un ulteriore livello di sicurezza al proprio account e lo fanno abilitando l'autenticazione a due fattori o 2FA (two factor authentication).Abbiamo visto cos'è l'autenticazione a due fattori e sappiamo che esistono vari metodi per implementarla e utilizzarla, alcuni molto più di sicuri di altri. Ad esempio gli SMS sono meno sicuri nell'ambito di un sistema per l'autenticazione a due fattori: la crescita vorticosa del numero di attacchi SIM swap ne è la conferma.\nCodici OTP: cosa sono\n Acronimo di One-time password, gli OTP sono codici che vengono generati sul dispositivo dell'utente e che sono validi, in combinazione con altri fattori (ad esempio username e password), per autenticarsi e ottenere l'accesso a un sito Web o un servizio online.Sono anche comunemente utilizzati per apporre la firma digitale remota, utile per sottoscrivere documenti digitali così come se vi si fosse applicata la propria firma autografa.Gli OTP sono anche conosciuti come 'password usa e getta' perché restano validi per breve tempo e in ogni caso solo per una singola sessione di accesso o una specifica transazione.I codici OTP vengono generati da parte di apposite app di autenticazione installabili e avviabili su un dispositivo mobile o su un computer.",

Quegli stessi soggetti che si cerca di tutelare.Oggi la Commissione Europea ha annunciato un'ulteriore nuova regolamentazione che mira a proteggere i minori dagli abusi.Anche in questo caso le finalità sono nobili ma le conseguenze degli adempimenti di cui si parla potrebbero rivelarsi estremamente invasivi e pericolosissimi sul piano della tutela della privacy.Stando a quanto proposto in sede europea, le applicazioni di messaggistica istantanea, comprese WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Signal e così via, saranno chiamate ad analizzare selettivamente i messaggi privati degli utenti alla ricerca di materiale pedopornografico e di comportamenti equiparabili ad attività di 'adescamento' di soggetti minorenni.Matthew Green, uno dei più noti e stimati docenti di crittografia, ha condannato senza appello la scelta europea definendo il documento presentato come 'il più terrificante mai visto finora.",

          "description": "Apple ha deciso di 'staccare la spina' a uno dei dispositivi che hanno fatto la storia dell'azienda. A distanza di 15 anni dalla sua nascita, la Mela interrompe la produzione dell'iPod Touch escludendo dal suo catalogo il rivoluzionario riproduttore musicale.L'annuncio non specifica esattamente quando iPod Touch, giunto nel frattempo alla sua settima generazione, verrà ritirato. Apple si è limitata a dire che il dispositivo sarà disponibile per l'acquisto soltanto fino ad esaurimento scorte: terminate le scorte di magazzino finirà anche il ciclo di vita dell'iPod Touch.Molto più di un semplice lettore musicale, iPod Touch può essere utilizzato come dispositivo di gioco portatile o come fotocamera digitale (da 8 Megapixel) ed è anche in grado di connettersi a Internet tramite WiFi. Piccolo e leggero con un jack cuffia non riceve telefonate e può essere utilizzato per ascoltare audiolibri o leggere e-book.Il modello più recente, presentato a maggio 2019, è l'unico rimasto in vita dopo l'abbandono dell'iPod Nano e dell'iPod Shuffle nel luglio 2017.Utilizza un chip A10 Fusion relativamente potente abbinato a un display Retina da 4 pollici e fino a 256 GB di memoria.Sebbene i lettori musicali portatili rappresentino oggi un mercato molto di nicchia, dato che gli smartphone fanno davvero tutto coprendo tutte le esigenze, ci sono alcune categorie di utenti che comunque sentiranno la mancanza dell'iPod.Apple non è un'azienda che fornisce troppe spiegazioni sulle decisioni strategiche riguardanti i suoi prodotti e servizi ma molto probabilmente l'accantonamento di iPod Touch ha a che fare con il contenuto numero di esemplari venduti e con lo stress che sta subendo l'intera catena produttiva (leggasi: meglio convergere le risorse su altri prodotti).Con l'addio all'iPod Touch, che attualmente supporta l'ultima versione di iOS disponibile, iOS 15, si chiude un'epoca.",

Nel documento, dal titolo '6G Spectrum: Expanding the Frontier', Samsung illustra le modalità di ottenimento delle frequenze necessarie per raggiungere la visione illustrata già quasi due anni fa, a luglio 2020.La società sudcoreana spiega che alla base del 6G vi è uno spettro con larghezza di banda contigua che spazia da centinaia di MHz a decine di GHz.",

To much excitement and a sign of the times, the embargo has just expired on this super-exciting milestone that many of us have been hoping to see for many years. Over the past two decades NVIDIA has offered great Linux driver support with their proprietary driver stack, but with the success of AMD's open-source driver effort going on for more than a decade, many have been calling for NVIDIA to open up their drivers. Their user-space software is remaining closed-source but as of today they have formally opened up their Linux GPU kernel modules and will be maintaining it moving forward. Here's the scoop on this landmark open-source decision at NVIDIA.",
