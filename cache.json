I know that manjaro is not really arch and it delays packages for 1-2 weeks which can cause stability issues, but it is still arch based and has a lot of similarities with it. \n Since I have been using it, my wifi has stopped working completely on two occasions, making me do a full reboot in order to get it working. Also the ui seems very buggy, like sometimes I increase the volume and the indicator on kde doesnt move and stuff like that. On one occasion, my monitor started glitching out all of a sudden and I needed to reboot to get it working again.\n I was thinking of switching to endeavourOs but I dont know if I will have a different experience.

The acceleration is incredibly high and the only touch gesture that works is a single tap to left click. I've tried restarting it with sudo modprobe -r psmouse and then sudo modprobe psmouse but it doesn't seem to do anything and I can't find anything else that might indicate a solution. So far, the only fix is to reboot my laptop which is a bit of a pain and defeats the purpose of sleep.\n Any help would be much appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/ApricotRembrandt  \n [link]   [comments]",

Black Lotus cita alcuni modelli di router a marchio Cisco, Netgear, Asus e DrayTek.ZuoRAT, una volta infettato il router, √® in grado di stabilire l'elenco dei dispositivi connessi raccogliendo contemporaneamente le richieste di risoluzione DNS e i pacchetti dati inviati e ricevuti.Alle spiccate abilit√† tecniche, ZuoRAT abbina funzionalit√† che gli permettono di rimanere nascosto e usare un 'basso profilo' per scavalcare eventuali tentativi di rilevamento.L'utilizzo di tecniche DNS e HTTP hijacking che hanno come obiettivo quello di modificare il traffico dati servendo ai dispositivi collegati contenuti che non sono quelli legittimi, √® evidente spia dell'approccio avanzato che ZuoRAT utilizza.Tanto che i ricercatori ipotizzano la realizzazione del malware a seguito di un ingente investimento da parte di qualche governo.Black Lotus ha aggiunto che l'infrastruttura command and control usata da ZuoRAT appare volutamente complessa con il preciso intento di celare ci√≤ che sta accadendo.",

Il fatto √® che lo spazio a disposizione nella memoria interna del telefono √® limitato e spesso, se si fosse soliti memorizzare tante foto, anche la micro SD - per quei dispositivi che integrano lo slot per accoglierla - tende a riempirsi velocemente.Ecco quindi che si guarda ai servizi di storage cloud come soluzione per creare una copia di backup dei dati e recuperare spazio prezioso sui propri dispositivi.Google Foto √® una delle soluzioni pi√π famose per creare backup della galleria su smartphone e altre dispositivi: da giugno 2021, per√≤, tutti i file caricati su Google Foto (comprese le foto in 'alta qualit√†') occupano spazio ed erodono il quantitativo di giga a disposizione sui server dell'azienda statunitense.Amazon Photos √® diverso e a tutti gli abbonati al servizio Prime (nel 2020 erano circa 150 milioni in tutto il mondo) assicura memorizzazione illimitata delle immagini: non importa che peso abbiano, su Amazon Photos √® possibile caricare ogni genere di foto, anche in formato RAW.",

Le immagini possono essere caricate ad alta risoluzione e addirittura in formato RAW: per gli abbonati ad Amazon Prime non ci sono limiti. Soltanto nel caso del backup dei video e di altri contenuti che non siano foto, Amazon impone un limite massimo di 5 GB.Inutile dire, quindi, quanto Amazon Photos sia un servizio apprezzato e popolare tra gli utenti.L'importante √® accertarsi di aver aggiornato l'app Android di Amazon Photos: gli sviluppatori di Checkmarx hanno infatti scoperto a suo tempo una vulnerabilit√† che √® stata nel frattempo risolta dei tecnici della societ√† guidata da Jeff Bezos.App malevole eventualmente presenti sullo stesso dispositivo Android avrebbero potuto sottrarre il token autorizzativo dall'app Amazon Photos e utilizzarlo per accedere, con l''identit√†' dell'utente, all'intero archivio fotografico e agli altri servizi Amazon.Nelle mani dei criminali informatici, il token Amazon avrebbe potuto essere sfruttato per diffondere ransomware crittografando tutti i dati dell'utente memorizzati sul cloud per poi richiedere un riscatto in denaro.L'attivit√† dei ransomware √® a torto generalmente collegata con attacchi che si concretizzano sui singoli sistemi locali mentre la tendenza √® quella di aggredire con sempre maggior frequenza i servizi di storage sul cloud, contenitori di dati personali di grande valore..",

Non √® sempre presente e quando lo √® segue il simbolo del punto interrogativo nell'URL.Abbiamo visto in un altro articolo cos'√® un URL, come funziona e quali sono i potenziali pericoli.I parametri contenuti nella querystring sono spesso necessari per il corretto funzionamento delle applicazioni Web perch√©, come accennato in precedenza, trasferiscono informazioni utili. Si pensi alla struttura dei collegamenti ipertestuali (link) presenti in una pagina Web: i dati della querystring possono ad esempio indicare il nome o l'identificativo del contenuto che l'utente vuole visualizzare.Come ricorda Mozilla, per√≤, alcuni parametri trasmessi attraverso la querystring non sono indispensabili per il funzionamento delle applicazioni Web e vengono utilizzati per inviare su server remoti informazioni sull'utente che visita una certa pagina.Cos√¨, con il rilascio di Firefox 102, Mozilla ha deciso di inserire nel suo browser un meccanismo che provvede a rimuovere dalla querystring quei parametri che vengono tipicamente utilizzati con finalit√† di marketing da aziende come Meta-Facebook, Marketo, Olytics, HubSpot, Drip, Vero ed altre ancora.Nelle impostazioni sulla privacy di Firefox, il browser Mozilla si riferisce alla nuova funzione parlando di blocco dei traccianti dei social media.Il nuovo strumento non risulta attivo per impostazione predefinita nelle finestre di navigazione in incognito ('finestra anonima').",

          "description": "Installare un secondo (o anche pi√π di uno) sistema operativo nel nostro computer √® sicuramente un‚Äôoperazione fattibile, per√≤ richiede la creazione di almeno una partizione aggiuntiva, inoltre avremo anche un boot manager per decidere quale sistema dovr√† avviarsi per primo. Il problema sorge quando dovremo sbarazzarci del secondo sistema, se non dovesse piacerci, o risultare non compatibile con il nostro computer e le nostre esigenze. Togliere il boot manager e le partizioni aggiuntive, se qualcosa dovesse andare storto durante queste operazioni, potrebbe comportare dei problemi al sistema operativo presente inizialmente da non poter pi√π avviarlo. Meglio allora virtualizzare.\n‚Ä∫‚Ä∫ Leggi tutto",
