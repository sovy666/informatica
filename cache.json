I do know that changing KDE language back to English can solve the problem but that's not what I really want.\n I know that there's a way to control pacman as it does have a config file stored somewhere but i'm not pretty sure how i can achieve it.\n Any help will be appreciated, thanks in advance !\n    submitted by    /u/1_7xr  \n [link]   [comments]",

Did a swap off and swapon to test the functions and the next boot it wouldn't start anymore. The boot hangs on unable to start modules or failed to start modules, tried for a hour chrooting inside of arch to fix it but i wasn't able to fix the system or at least installing a package from chroot :$ or use systemctl. \n So this is the third time reinstalling arch I'm on the verge to add a user and following the tutorial of kde-plasma but this is what I don't understand:\n I read a lot of tutorials about \"it's a bad idea to run for example kde as root user. Steps that need to be done according to the tutorials. 1. Create a user with home dir or not 2. install sudo 3. Add user to the sudoers file. \n But all the users inside of the sudoers file have the same privilege as the root user, only a different password. That seems unsafe for me. \n Also yay needs to be installed on the second user account, and can install packages stand alone. \n Isn't there a better way to all of this?\n To make it that the second user only can acces all the necessary stuff but can't use fdisk, pacman, yay, etc.\n But kde needs to have some acces to adjust themes and so on. \n Thanks for helping and reading my post :)\n    submitted by    /u/Pure_Pasifist  \n [link]   [comments]",

The fixes I've tried so far are:\n  \ndo not use root=ZFS=rpool/ROOT/default but root:ZFS=rpool/ROOT/default suggested here \n The result was, that the error changed and it complained about missing NFS in the emergency shell even though I don't use an NFS mounts\n \n do not use root=ZFS=rpool/ROOT/default but zfs=rpool/ROOT/default in the linxu in grub \n I'm still dropped into the emergency shell, but the error messaged changed to zfs_mount_at(): encryption key not loaded.

          "description": "Chi utilizza da tempo un PC sa riconoscere benissimo quando la macchina utilizza almeno un hard disk. I dischi fissi tradizionali utilizzano infatti più piatti in rapida rotazione: su ciascuno di essi 'volano' a una distanza di pochi nanometri le testine che si occupano della lettura e della scrittura dei dati.Quando un hard disk che era rimasto inutilizzato si avvia per cominciare un'attività di lettura o scrittura, esso entra nella fase di spin-up: i piatti vengono accelerati per essere messi in rotazione fino a raggiungere la velocità di rotazione operativa. È immediato riconoscere il rumore di un hard disk che sta effettuando lo spin-up.Nell'articolo su come riparare gli hard disk abbiamo presentato anche i rumori che vengono generalmente prodotti dalle unità che hanno qualche problema hardware.Le unità SSD essendo basate esclusivamente su memorie flash non hanno parti in movimento e non fanno rumore: in un altro articolo abbiamo visto le principali differenze tra hard disk e SSD.Nel caso di un PC desktop aprendo il case è piuttosto semplice riconoscere quali sono hard disk e quali unità SSD.Gli SSD meno performanti utilizzando la stessa interfaccia SATA (nel caso di SATA III in grado di trasferire fino a 6 Gbps) degli hard disk; le unità SSD più moderne e performanti utilizzando il bus PCI Express ormai giunto alla versione 5.0 (PCIe 5.0) in una continua escalation in termini di banda e prestazioni.Come visto nell'articolo dedicato agli SSD PCIe NVMe quelli basati su interfaccia PCIe 3.0 possono trasferire dati fino a 3.500 MB/s e 3.300 MB/s in lettura e scrittura; fino a 7.000 MB/s e 5.000 MB/s rispettivamente in lettura e scrittura con PCIe 4.0 usando schede madri con chipset e processori compatibili.",

          "description": "Negli Stati Uniti gli operatori di telecomunicazioni hanno la facoltà di utilizzare i loro strumenti per monitorare la navigazione online degli abbonati e usare i dati raccolti per finalità di marketing, anche trasferendoli a soggetti terzi. Esistono diversi modi per navigare anonimi senza che neppure il provider possa registrare le pagine Web visitate. Una normativa che ammette il tracciamento delle attività online da parte dei provider solleva comunque più di qualche dubbio.Un concetto simile viene adesso portato in Europa, nonostante nel Vecchio Continente il tema della privacy sia molto più sentito che dall'altra sponda dell'oceano.I colleghi di Heise raccontano che in Germania operatori come Vodafone e Deutsche Telekom stanno testando un nuovo sistema per assegnare a ogni utente abbonato ai servizi di connettività un identificativo univoco con finalità di marketing.Il nuovo meccanismo si chiama TrustID: si tratta di una piattaforma lato provider Internet che assegna a ciascuna utenza un identificativo che viene poi utilizzato per creare un profilo personale basato sulla cronologia di navigazione.",

Curiosamente i valori indicati da Phison risultano inferiori a quanto mostrato in precedenza dall'azienda al CES 2022 anche se adesso i risultati si riferiscono a una vera e propria unità.\n\nNel caso delle operazioni di lettura/scrittura random 4K i valori ottenuti sono un po’ più bassi (fino a 5,4-4,8 GB/s) perché si fa riferimento ai due casi estremi ovvero alla situazione in cui si sfrutta tutto il parallelismo o a quella in cui c'è solo un processo attivo.Come curiosità va detto che l'unità usata da Phison per i test ha un formato M.2 2580: ciò significa che è 3 mm più larga della solita versione M.2 2280.",

Questi problematiche diventano ancora più delicate quando l'azienda condivide i suoi dati e i suoi asset in tutto o in parte sul cloud permettendo il collegamento di dipendenti, collaboratori, partner, fornitori da più sedi fisicamente separate l'una dall'altra.La tecnologia SD-WAN (Software-defined WAN) aiuta a stabilire connessioni remote sicure con la rete dell'impresa, indipendentemente dalla sua struttura e se essa si serva o meno di risorse cloud.Lo schema tradizionale basato sull'utilizzo di router si limita semplicemente a consentire l'instradamento del traffico in base agli indirizzi TCP/IP e alle ACL (access control list).",
