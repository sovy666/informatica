          "description": "Who's this guide for: people with windows system that got another ssd and they want to put linux in it. And they want to use systemd-boot instead of GRUB.\n ​\n STEP 1\n Disable fast boot and then secure boot.\n If it is greyed out then try rebooting after disabling fast boot.\n If it is still greyed out you might need to set an admin UEFI password or there's some other feature in the UEFI that uses secure boot.\n ​\n STEP 2\n Install linux on the new ssd, make sure to double check it's the correct one. You gotta also format it from the installer, archlinux has that option too. \n Usually, you can easily detect the new SSD because it has all it's space as free space too, whereas a windows SSD will have something different.\n P.S. I downloaded archinstall with pacman and then used that to install archlinux. Recommended for new users.\n ​\n STEP 3\n After linux installation finished.\n Type \"sudo fdisk -l\" in the terminal and you'll see a partition that says EFI System at the end of the row. Take the device of that row, e.g. \"/dev/nvme1n1p1\"\n Type \"sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1p1 /mnt\" but instead of /dev/nvme1n1p1 put your own device partition path.\n Then \"cd /mnt/EFI\"\n Then \"cp -R ./Microsoft /boot/EFI\"\n ​\n ​\n That's it. It's so simple with systemd-boot and it works flawlessly for me. In this way Archlinux is in charge of the boot and after booting you computer you'll have few seconds to pick an OS.\n ​\n ​\n This is a barebone guide, please be careful when doing anything as you're responsible for your device not me. And some things may be different based on person to person case.\n    submitted by    /u/KronozFX  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've tried using pwmconfig and setting it to manual mode with a user defined curve which it follows until it suddenly decides it wants to to go full speed. I've also tried using the fancontrol script (and fancontrol-gui) and it works until it doesn't, there doesn't seem to be any reason for the fan speed to ignore fancontrol. I thought it was a issue with zero RPM mode so I made a config that doesnt turn the fans off, that hasn't worked either. The card is often at \"low\" temperatures (sub 50 c) when it ramps. I can still stop the fans with pwmconfig, but I dont want to keep them stopped. \n I've tried searching for someone with the same issue, all I get are guides on configuring fanspeed of pwm-capable fans, I am lost.\n I dont know what else about my system I need to provide, I am currently using the LTS kernel 5.15.48-1-lts\n Here is my current fancontrol config, though it has the same behavior without it.\n https://www.toptal.com/developers/hastebin/mamabehuja.apache\n    submitted by    /u/T3-cube  \n [link]   [comments]",

It worked perfectly fine with KDE+i3-gaps, so this is clearly a config issue on my part. I've run into issues with it accessing connection/OpenVPN specific credentials before, which I believe is why I had to install gnome-keyring alongside Kwallet, as I'd rather have just used Kwallet.

I could also see /boot in my fstab (I should maybe mention, however, that it is on a different partition).\n My googling also revealed that not having mounted boot while in chroot and then updating the system may have caused the issue.

In un nostro articolo abbiamo visto quali frequenze WiFi 6E sono state autorizzate in Europa per ampliare ulteriormente larghezza di banda, ridurre la latenza e interferenze.La prima iterazione del WiFi risale al 1997 con la pubblicazione delle specifiche del protocollo 802.11, in grado di permettere il trasferimento dati fino a 2 Mbps.Nel 1999 venne formata l'organizzazione Wi-Fi Alliance per gestire il marchio commerciale Wi-Fi e seguire gli sviluppi della tecnologia.",

Riuscire a trasferire le informazioni con un limite fisico pari a quello della velocità della luce porta con sé immense sfide ed enormi opportunità.Nelle telecomunicazioni e nelle reti di computer la fibra ottica utilizza fotoni (luce) che si propagano lungo il mezzo trasmissivo al posto della corrente elettrica.Sono in corso numerosi progetti per utilizzare le proprietà della fotonica nell'informatica velocizzando significativamente le comunicazioni anche in 'piccola scala', a livello di interfaccia.I ricercatori dell'Università di Oxford hanno sviluppato il primo processore fotonico che utilizza la polarizzazione della luce per massimizzare la densità delle informazioni elaborate e le prestazioni di calcolo.La polarizzazione della radiazione elettromagnetica indica la direzione dell'oscillazione del vettore campo elettrico durante la propagazione dell'onda nello spazio-tempo.",

          "description": "Quando si parla delle batterie di smartphone, tablet, dispositivi indossabili, altoparlanti Bluetooth e altri prodotti tecnologici di dimensioni compatte si fa spesso riferimento al termine mAh.Il simbolo mAh sta per milliampereora ed è utilizzato per esprimere la capacità di carica di una batteria. Il milliampereora è un sottomultiplo dell'unità di misura della carica elettrica ampera-ora (Ah) e ne rappresenta la millesima parte.L'ampere, com'è noto, misura l'intensità della corrente elettrica: con il termine 1 mAh si fa riferimento a un milliampere erogato per 3600 secondi (1 ora).Una batteria da 3.000 mAh è un dispositivo che può mantenere in uscita una corrente pari appunto a 3.000 mA per un'ora.È importante notare che i mAh sono solo una misura della capacità: non determinano la velocità con cui il caricabatterie riesce a caricare la batteria del dispositivo. La carica batteria veloce varia da un caricatore all'altro a seconda di una serie di fattori tra cui anche il supporto per la ricarica rapida.Va detto inoltre che la carica assorbita dal dispositivo al quale la batteria è collegata solitamente varia (e molto) nel corso del tempo.",
