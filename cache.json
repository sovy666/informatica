Right now it seems like a damned if you do damned if you don't situation because if I don't update it while I'm away then I'll come back with potentially several bits of manual intervention I need to do which could cause issues with each other and be a nightmare, or I can try to update regularly and get a few cases of manual intervention, that I may not be able to fix and I'll just be SOL for potentially weeks. \n I originally considered using an arch derivative like Manjaro but now I'm hearing that Manjaro doesn't actually keep great compatibility with the AUR and has it's own issues so I basically have no idea at this point.\n    submitted by    /u/temmiesayshoi  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've tried installing arch ~5 times using archinstall and 2 times manually. I'm using an NVIDIA RTX3050 mobile so that's probably the culprit.\n Xorg logs don't show anything peculiar. Journalctl also shows completely normal logs. Using nvidia-xconfig does nothing. Deleting /etc/X11/xorg.conf does nothing. Deleting the entire /etc/X11/xorg.d/ does nothing. Following the wiki about using an NVIDIA card for everything without care of power does nothing. (did everything word for word as was suggested in the wiki 2 times with no luck).\n Anyway, doing startx freezes my laptop and the fans ramp up. I also tried just leaving it like that for an hour with no change. Only the poweroff button has any effect (shell complains that it doesn't understand the input). I still couldn't get any inputs in. For example, ctrl+alt+fx did nothing.\n I've installed arch ~10 times in virtual machines and different desktops and laptops. I've used arch for years and I've never seen anything like this. Google doesn't give any helpful results either. I tried every possible fix the first two google pages recommended. I've never dealt with NVIDIA cards so I believe this is something exclusive to them.\n Also, I'm using an Acer Nitro 5 with an RTX3050 and an 11th gen i5 CPU if that has anything to do with this issue.\n If anyone has a fix or could help me, please let me know.

Essa equivale all'elaborazione di 275 film con risoluzione Full HD in un secondo.Il colosso sudcoreano spiega che le DRAM GDDR6 sono composte da chip da 16 Gb che utilizzano il processo costruttivo a 10 nm di terza generazione. In fase di produzione è stato fatto ricorso alla litografia ultravioletta estrema (EUV) e ad alcune soluzioni architetturali per fare sì che il gate mantenga più carica.Samsung afferma che una soluzione del genere ha permesso di ottenere una DRAM di ultima generazione che funziona a una velocità superiore al 30% rispetto alla DRAM GDDR6 da 18 Gbps.La DRAM segue gli ultimi standard stabiliti dal JEDEC, l'organismo che si occupa della definizione degli standard per i chip di memoria, in modo che i fornitori di hardware per l'intelligenza artificiale e i produttori di acceleratori grafici possano servirsene facilmente nei loro prodotti.Samsung ha precisato di aver anche applicato la tecnica del dynamic voltage switching (DVS) per aumentare l'efficienza energetica della DRAM.",

Queste lacune di sicurezza hanno portato i ricercatori a intensificare gli studi sul funzionamento dei processori: negli anni seguenti sono infatti venute a galla molteplici vulnerabilità alle quali i produttori hardware e software hanno risposto in maniera differente.Sono state infatti realizzate patch che agiscono a livello di microcodice, kernel, driver, sistema operativo e persino lato applicativo per ridurre al minimo la superficie di attacco.In mancanza delle patch correttive, un aggressore che interagisce con i meccanismi di branch prediction della CPU o misura il tempo di esecuzione delle istruzioni in alcuni casi può recuperare dati personali e informazioni riservate, comprese password e chiavi di decodifica.Per lungo tempo (e in parte ancora oggi) gli attacchi come Spectre, Meltdown così come tutte le varianti successivamente emerse, sono stati considerati di grande interesse ma di scarsa valenza pratica.",
