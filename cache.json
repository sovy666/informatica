          "description": "Hey guys,\n So recently I've decided to create an interesting project: Use FreeBSD as a guest with my dGPU via GPU Passthrough. But it's got a lot of caveats to it and I wonder if someone could help me.\n The first reason why I'm not installing straight into my machine is because it's a Surface Book (1st Gen - Performance Base Edition) which doesn't even recognize the keyboard after trying to install it via an external one. So it has to have a Linux kernel and run it as a guest.\n The second problem is that despite running almost perfectly, the laptop requires a custom kernel called surface-linux in order to have stable WiFi connection and recognize the NVIDIA dGPU.\n Following along, the third problem was switching between the iGPU and the dGPU. In that case, I've opted for the optimus-manager project in order to switch between them. It's works great with Arch.\n So the only way I could run FreeBSD with the NVIDIA dGPU would be by using a Type 1 Hypervisor such as KVM. That would be the only way to get the GPU Passthrough.\n I've read ArchWiki article regarding GPU Passthrough extensively. I was able to isolate the NVIDIA dGPU, by loading only the vfio-pci drivers when turning on, but I'm still not able to connect with the VM using it.\n One thing to notice is that when using lspci the NVIDIA dGPU appear as 3D Graphics, and not VGA. I'm pretty sure this is the reason why I cannot fully detach it.\n Can anyone help me with this project?\n    submitted by    /u/toasty_fe  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello Friends.\n I launched the curated user repository a few weeks ago and now comes the package manager to go with it.\n AUR packages are reviewed and whitelisted. Additional package recipes are directly shipped with the curated repo.\n So far it works really well. But it is brand-new - so please bear with me, if something goes wrong. Please file a github issue, if you encounter a bug.\n Right now, the basic feature set is implemented. You can use it to install and remove packages. Additional features are planned in the future. Please give it a try and let me know in the comments, if there is something you wish to have.\n Also... Feel free to file a github pull request, if there is a package you'd like to have included.\n I created a helper script, that makes it very easy to add additional packages to the AUR whitelist. If you want to bump a package version, simply re-run the script with the package name and it will update to the latest version:\n  $ aur-whitelist build2 # whitelist build2 4424cce8e2f4d87fa54b1b53a354dec7d784e8f9 build2 $ aur-whitelist build2 # already up-to-date already accepted, skipping: build2 \n -- flydude\n P.S.: Some of you might wonder, if this qualifies as an AUR helper. Not really, I'd say. We do include high-quality packages from the AUR. But the packages are reviewed and maintained inside a single git repo. Therefore it's more like Gentoo Portage (hence the name).\n    submitted by    /u/flying-dude  \n [link]   [comments]",

A stretto rigore, un'unità viene dapprima inizializzata ovvero predisposta a livello logico con la creazione di una o più partizioni secondo un preciso schema di partizionamento (GPT o MBR).Le partizioni di hard disk, SSD e unità rimovibili vengono utilizzate per suddividere i dati. In una partizione, ad esempio, si può installare il sistema operativo mentre l'altra accoglierà i dati.Nel caso di molti sistemi operativi vengono create, sullo stesso supporto, una partizione che si occupa di gestire la procedura di avvio mentre in un'altra vengono salvati i file che fanno funzionare il sistema vero e proprio (e che vengono caricati successivamente).",
