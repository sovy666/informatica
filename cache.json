Occasionally I will be able to see all the networks that I should be able to, but, after an attempted connection timing out, the networks are no longer found by network manager. What is very odd it that this problem seems to be local to the wifi networks in use at my university. I was perfectly able to find and connect to networks in a cafe yesterday. It has crossed my mind that my credentials could have been blacklisted from the wifi (my torrenting is distros and copyright free material, obviously) but this can't be the case because my phone and other laptop connect fine with the same credentials.\n I should make clear that in some buildings of my university, I am able to see and connect to eduroam, so I'm pretty sure the problem isn't related to how I have the eduroam connection configured. \n The hardware I am using is Qualcomm Atheros AR9285 Wireless Network Adapter (PCI-Express) and the ath9k kernel driver. I am running kernel version Linux 5.17.8-arch1-1.\n I can and would provide logs but because I am in the dark about what is going wrong I don't know which logs would be relevant as the ones I have looked through don't appear to show anything obviously wrong.

          "description": "So, the wiki states that when compiling the crash kernel for kdump one should change the package base name to \"linux-kdump\" or similar to distinguish it from the normal kernel. A consequence of this is that my vmlinux file has, according to crash, version \"5.17.8-arch1-1-kdump\".\n The problem is that my system kernel is of version \"5.17.8-arch1-1\" and so when running \"crash vmlinux crash.dump\" it tells me that there is an inconsistency between kernel versions of the vmlinux file and the crash dump:\n 'WARNING: kernel version inconsistency between vmlinux and dumpfile\n WARNING: cannot find matching kernel version in vmlinux file:\n verify_namelist:\n dumpfile /proc/version:\n Linux version 5.17.8-arch1-1 (linux@archlinux) (gcc (GCC) 12.1.0, GNU ld (GNU Binutils) 2.38) #1 SMP PREEMPT Mon, 16 May 2022 20:45:27 +0000\n vmlinux:\n Linux version 5.17.8-arch1-1-kdump (linux-kdump@archlinux) (gcc (GCC) 12.1.0, GNU ld (GNU Binutils) 2.38) #2 SMP PREEMPT Wed, 18 May 2022 00:42:02 +0000'\n Am I misunderstanding the instructions about naming the kernel, or am I misunderstanding how to use crash?

But I know Arch is not easy, especially for someone who is not on Linux for a long time. I will learn a bit first, try to install it on my other PC which is basically for testing things and then after some time of learning switch to Arch entirely.

Anzi Seiko Epson, come si chiama oggi: nei primi anni di vita, infatti, gli elementi che hanno alimentato la crescita dell'azienda erano incentrati sul perfezionamento delle tecnologie di microlavorazione e di elaborazione ad alta precisione sviluppate per gli orologi e il loro impiego in altri campi applicativi.Daiwa Kogyo fu creata proprio da un negoziante di orologi locale, Hisao Yamazaki, e ricevette il supporto della famiglia di imprenditori che fondò il Gruppo Seiko.\n\nL'Epson Museum Suwa, situato nella sede di Suwa (prefettura di Nagano, Giappone), è stato inaugurato oggi proprio con l'intento di descrivere l'intera storia della società, dalla fondazione ai giorni nostri.",
