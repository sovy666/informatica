          "description": "Dear fellow Arch enjoyers,\n I have a problem which is not directly related to arch. However, I am sure that I can help myself with your knowhow.\n _________________________________________________________________\n Background:\n When I assembled my first PC 4 years ago, I had no experience at all with PCs, let alone with building them. My colleagues helped me assemble the PC and set up practically everything for me. Among the installed parts was a wireless network card which I connected to my Gigabyte Z370 HD3 mainboard.\n Since the beginning, however, I had a problem, namely that my PC always started up by itself after I had shut it down. After quite a bit of trial and error, I found out that it was the network card which caused the problem.\n I sold it and stayed without wifi and bluetooth for a few years until I recently bought a new network card (Gigabyte GC-WBAX210) and behold, the same problem occurs again.\n ___________________________________________________________________\n Troubleshooting:\n At first I thought of wake on lan or better said wake on wireless lan but all settings in the BIOS and in the network manager are disabled. I have also tried several interfaces on my mainboard but without success. As with the previous model, the card is connected via a PCIEx1 interface and an internal USB 2 cable. After extensive reading of the wiki and other posts, I am unfortunately still at the same point.\n ____________________________________________________________________\n Request:\n I would therefore like to ask you if you know of any ways of dealing with this problem in arch.\n ____________________________________________________________________\n Info dump:\n lshw\n ifconfig\n lsusb\n lspci\n    submitted by    /u/AfGandalfistan  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This might be a dumb question and I'm pretty sure it's not possible but I want to be certain.\n This afternoon I moved from mkinitcpio to booster (mainly becase of the speed in image generation and slight boot time improvement) and it's been great, the EFISTUB configuration was even simpler. The only thing I'm missing is LUKS autounlocking at boot. I only use a keyfile for unlocking when I'm at home, otherwise I input the password.\n With mkinitcpio this is achieved easily, my USB is automounted by fstab and then the keyfile is used to unlock the partition, if the USB can't be read in 3s then it defaults to password prompt by using the luks option \"keyfile-timeout\".\n When I first booted using the image generated by booster it gave me an error saying that keyfile-timeout option wasn't recognised, I selected my previous boot entry, then looked up the booster manpage and found this:\n  \nrd.luks.options=opt1,opt2 a comma-separated list of LUKS flags. Supported options are discard, same-cpu-crypt, submit-from-crypt-cpus, no-read-workqueue, no-write-workqueue.\n  \nI just want to know if there's a workaround for the keyfile timeout. I'll continue to use booster even if it isn't but it would be nice to have autounlocking. Sorry for the long post lol and thanks in advance\n    submitted by    /u/miscawelo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I know that in many contexts, \"modern\" installers for Linux like Flatpak, Snap, and Appimage get a lot of hate, with the recommendation being \"Just use default repos, AUR, or install from source.\" \n That being said, it is a fairly recurring phenomenon for the AUR version of an application to be behind or even abandoned, whereas most developers have an official release on one of these modern platforms. AUR repos are not audited for malware so it is really not safe to use AUR helpers to automate the install, meaning the expectation is that you manually examine the source and recompile every update, which is fairly unrealistic. \n Regardless of the standard arguments about \"sandboxing\" etc. it seems pretty straightforward to prefer an official release over a user repackaging for apps that are not already in the standard repos. \n As a bonus, the updates can be automated with relatively high trust. \n I am curious if there is a legitimate technical reason why my reasoning is fallacious.

Sigle di questo tipo presenti nel nome del router stanno a significare lo standard supportato dal dispositivo.Nei router più recenti compare la sigla AX a indicare che il prodotto supporta lo standard WiFi 6 (802.11 ax)Sulla carta WiFi 6 consente di raggiungere velocità di trasferimento dati fino a 9,6 Gbps anche se all'atto pratico è estremamente difficile avvicinarsi a questo valore. Molto dipende anche dai dispositivi WiFi collegati: se non sono compatibili WiFi 6 e se non possono i canali più ampi le prestazioni massime risulteranno molto più ridotte: ne parliamo nel dettaglio nell'articolo che abbiamo citato poco sopra.La sigla AC fa riferimento al supporto per lo standard WiFi 5 (WiFi 5) che sulla carta non permette di superare i 6,9 Gbps in condizioni ottimali.La sigla N indica i router più vecchi che supportano solo WiFi 4 (802.11 n) e che sono contraddistinti da prestazioni complessivamente più mediocri.Tutti i router AX, AC e N possono lavorare sulle frequenze dei 2,4 GHz e dei 5 GHz.L'indicazione BE non è ancora utilizzata e sarà parte integrante del nome del modello di tutti quei router compatibili WiFi 7.- WiFi 6E.",

È molto grande e monta un enorme display da 7 pollici con un rapporto d'aspetto 21:10; ha bordi arrotondati e risulterà piuttosto difficile da usare con una sola mano. Il rapporto d'aspetto è insolito per gli smartphone ma si rivela una soluzione ideale per la visualizzazione di contenuti multimediali e il multitasking.Lo schermo utilizza un pannello Samsung AMOLED con una risoluzione pari a 3080 x 1440 pixel supportata nativamente.Il display è di alta qualità, come conferma la valutazione A+ di DisplayMate, assicura una luminosità massima di 1.500 nits e una copertura della gamma di colori DCI-P3 pari al 112%.\n\nNascosto dietro lo schermo c'è un lettore di impronte digitali a ultrasuoni (si tratta di un Qualcomm 3D Sonic Max): è talmente ampio che può acquisire contemporaneamente due impronte digitali migliorando la sicurezza.Per quanto concerne la restante parte dell'hardware Vivo X Note monta il SoC Qualcomm al momento più avanzato e performante, lo Snapdragon 8 Gen 1.",

While much of the graphics support has been squared away for Intel Arc DG2/Alchemist as covered in prior articles, it turns out the compute support is still settling but there is now a patch series pending for actually exposing it...",
