Or, more specifically, things like file managers no longer see it as such, however xdg-open still opens the files without issues and xdg-mime query default video/x-matroska still reports mpv.desktop.\n I tried removing the MIME part of the override's desktop file and removing the original file from usr, under the assumptions i might have made it ambiguous - nothing fixes it, except removing my override altogether.\n I'm not entirely sure what causes it, since it works with the xdg tools perfectly fine.

The server works like it should, I can connect to it from my smartphone or my laptop. On my laptop I imported the wireguard config in network manager. Everything works as expected, it even automatically connects to the VPN after suspend or hibernate and also after disabling and reenabling WiFi in the gnome settings. However as soon as I switch to an different WiFi network NetworkManager goes complete nuts. The nmcli command line program as well as the gnome network settings become completely unresponsive. While I can ping IP addresses with ping and resolve hostnames with nslookup no websites load and trace route gets stuck after some hops. Rebooting fixes the issue. Neighter dmesg nor journalctl give any relevant info, they behave like nothing happened except for ah coredump when gnome-settings crashes. I tried some of the dns related stuff in the wiki like the systemd-resolved symlink or using openresolv but that didn't change a thing. I honestly have no idea where to take it from here.

          "description": "I did my Arch install a long time ago using Gnome and Xorg I'm trying to switch to wayland. Would this still be the proper way of switching or is this method outdated?\n First, you need to enable NVIDIA kernel modesetting, to do this add the kernel parameter nvidia-drm.modeset=1. Next, ensure that GDM wayland isn't disabled (this isn't strictly necessary since you can launch GNOME from command line). Go to /etc/gdm/custom.conf, and comment out the waylandenable=false line if it is present. Next, you need to edit a udev rule. Edit /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/61-gdm.rules (location might vary based on distro, however its usually there). And comment out the line that mentions disabling wayland if NVIDIA proprietary driver is present. Reboot, you should now be able to use GNOME on Wayland on proprietary NVIDIA driver. And note again that you won't have Xwayland acceleration or it won't work at all, and that there are some NVIDIA eglstreams specific bugs, and that certian functions might have reduced performance compared to GBM. \n    submitted by    /u/Artichoke93  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Questa settimana Microsoft festeggia ben 30 anni dal rilascio della versione finale di Windows 3.1, una versione importante dell''ambiente operativo', molto più di quanto non suggerisca la numerazione a suo tempo utilizzata: '3.1' fa pensare a una 'release minore' piuttosto che a un rilascio in grande stile.Abbiamo scritto 'ambiente operativo' perché all'epoca Windows non era ancora un sistema operativo vero e proprio: si presentava come un'interfaccia grafica da caricarsi al di sopra di MS-DOS o di PC DOS.Microsoft rilasciò Windows 3.1 a inizio aprile 1992, solo due anni dopo l'arrivo di Windows 3.0. Il predecessore di Windows 3.1 fu accolto positivamente dall'industria e dagli utenti finali ma mancava di componenti chiave, soffriva di tanti difetti (bug), usava font bitmap e veniva espressamente presentato come una sorta di add-on per MS-DOS.Rendendosi conto della necessità di rimanere competitivi con i Mac di Apple e in vista del salto ai 32 bit con il successivo Windows 95, Microsoft aveva assolutamente necessità di stringere i tempi e rilasciare Windows 3.1 nel più breve tempo possibile.",

È inoltre possibile usare JavaScript come linguaggio di scripting e MonoDevelop come IDE per coloro che vogliono un'alternativa a Visual Studio.Quasi tutto può essere animato con Unity: i creatori di contenuti e gli artisti se ne servono per creare scene 3D o costruire animazioni 2D da zero. Poiché Unity esiste ormai dal 2005 ha potuto raccogliere un enorme seguito di utenti in tutti questi anni e portare a maturazione un'incredibile libreria di risorse.\n\nNella foto Peter Moore, classe 1955.",

          "description": "Nel corso degli ultimi 5 anni i processori Intel e AMD hanno fatto registrare un'evoluzione davvero incredibile, molto più veloce e profonda rispetto a quella vissuta nel periodo 2011-2016. Questa evoluzione è stata principalmente guidata dalle innovazioni che AMD ha introdotto con la sua architettura Zen anche se non va posta in secondo piano le risposta di Intel arrivata con i processori Tiger Lake prima e poi con gli Alder Lake di dodicesima generazione.Molto è successo dall'arrivo sul mercato dei processori Ryzen 1000, una generazione di CPU AMD che ha rivoluzionato il panorama dei chip e portato il confronto con la rivale Intel a un nuovo livello.Per capire meglio la portata delle modifiche che sono state introdotte con AMD Zen basti pensare che dal momento dell'introduzione degli Intel Core 2 nel 2006 i processori quad-core erano rimasti lo standard ad alte prestazioni per il mercato mainstream: ogni rilascio di Intel nel mercato dei processori consumer tra il 2006 e il 2017 è stato limitato a un massimo di quattro core e otto thread.",

          "description": "Intel ha annunciato di aver tagliato un importante traguardo presso il suo stabilimento irlandese (Fab 34): la litografia ultravioletta estrema (EUV) è un processo costruttivo che permette di produrre, a partire dai wafer in silicio, chip sempre più miniaturizzati.Gli scanner litografici rappresentano la parte del processo produttivo che porta a realizzare un processore: stampano la microarchitettura di ogni singolo chip su un wafer di silicio scannerizzando un modello e trasferendone l'immagine sul wafer stesso che viene poi sviluppato. Sebbene gli scanner litografici facciano parte del processo produttivo dei chip da diversi anni, la più recente versione della tecnologia, EUV, consente di stampare i circuiti in dimensioni più ridotte e con una maggiore precisione.Azienda leader nella produzione di macchinari per l'utilizzo della soluzione EUV è l'olandese ASML, spesso tirata in ballo anche di recente quando si è parlato di Chips Act e degli sforzi europei per spostare una buona parte della produzione di chip nel vecchio continente entro il 2030.\n\nLo specifico sistema EUV prodotto da ASML e installato presso l'impianto Fab 34 di Intel in Irlanda è probabilmente il più complesso macchinario mai costruito: è composto da 100.000 parti, 3.000 cavi, 40.000 bulloni e più di un chilometro e mezzo di tubi.",
