          "description": "Hi everyone, I'm shortly going to attempt a fresh arch install, but while planning it out I've realised that i want an earlier Gnome DE version, specifically Gnome 41 (which is to say 41.5 afaik). \n To do this, I've been reading around in the arch wiki and in this section, it tells me that i can indeed do this by adding Server=https://archive.archlinux.org/repos/2014/03/30/$repo/os/$arch in /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist. Now my question is, how feasible is this? Can i add this line in pacman.d just before i do pacman -S gnome? And will doing this ensure that i get G41.5 when i boot up to the DE? I'm planning of putting in a date just before Gnome 42 reached the official arch repositories, so i can get the gnome version just before Gnome 42. \n Please let me know if I'm missing something or getting something wrong, thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/NakamericaIsANoob  \n [link]   [comments]",

Looks more like a seizure attack but for a computer. Secondly VNC, how do i get it back or still continue to use it? Id appreciate that a lot but idk if i can though, i could set up a package for it but then that may not work well though Finnally, they all dont work when the pc is locked. I have to keep my pc locked die to reasons but id still like to be able to least use SSH while its locked though honestly.\n if anyone at all, has any pointers for myself.

          "description": "L'autenticazione a due fattori è uno strumento che serve a evitare che un criminale informatico, venuto in possesso delle altrui credenziali di accesso corrette (username e password), possa accedere a un servizio online con l'identità di un altro soggetto.In un altro articolo abbiamo visto cos'è l'autenticazione a due fattori e come si gestisce nel modo migliore.Per accedere a un servizio online protetto con l'autenticazione a due fattori (2FA o Two Factor Authentication, che Google chiama verifica in due passaggi) di solito è necessario autorizzare l'accesso da un dispositivo affidabile (ad esempio utilizzando un app 'ad hoc' che informa l'utente circa ogni nuovo tentativo di autenticazione), digitare un codice OTP (one-time-password) generato sul device mobile, utilizzare una chiavetta o token FIDO2 oppure meccanismi biometrici.Gli accademici dell'Università del Salento Franco Tommasi, Christian Catalano e Ivan Taurino hanno dimostrato che anche l'autenticazione a due fattori può essere superata utilizzando un attacco chiamato Browser-in-the-Middle (BitM).L'aggressione, almeno dal punto di vista della terminologia, ricorda il noto attacco Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) in cui un aggressore, postosi tra due soggetti che partecipano a una comunicazione, può monitorare e leggere i messaggi scambiati eventualmente modificandoli a suo piacimento.",

          "description": "Tra le cose da cambiare in Windows 11 gli utenti da tempo stanno chiedendo la possibilità di spostare la barra delle applicazioni ai lati dello schermo o nella parte superiore. È la richiesta che ha raccolto in assoluto più voti, almeno fino ad oggi.Eppure Microsoft sembra essere piuttosto sorda sull'argomento: nel corso di una recente sessione Ask Me Anything, Tali Roth, responsabile di prodotto presso Microsoft, ha dichiarato che soltanto una piccola fetta di utenti usa riposizionare la barra delle applicazioni sullo schermo. Pur comprendendo e rispettando le necessità espresse da questo piccolo gruppo di utenti, l'azienda di Redmond preferisce concentrarsi sullo sullo sviluppo di altre funzioni del sistema operativo.Roth non esclude che in futuro la barra delle applicazioni torni a essere liberamente posizionabile sullo schermo ma è qualcosa che comunque in ogni caso non avverrà nel breve periodo.Il manager di Microsoft spiega che sebbene le somiglianze con Windows 10 siano tante, in Windows 11 l'interfaccia utente è radicalmente cambiata con il design Mica e un 'linguaggio' nuovo rispetto al precedente sistema operativo.Il portavoce di Microsoft osserva ancora che quando si pensa alla possibilità di spostare la barra delle applicazioni di Windows 11 in diverse posizioni sullo schermo ci sono una serie di sfide da affrontare.",

The hardware drivers have low-level access to your Windows system so that they can work as they should. Since the drivers get access to the kernel, Windows requires those drivers to be officially signed. This means Microsoft tries to block any attempt to install unsigned drivers in Windows.\n    \nHowever, there will be times when you need to install unofficial drivers, unsigned drivers, or even old drivers with no digital signature. It’s possible but not quite as easy as installing signed drivers.\n    \nNote: Checking driver signatures is a security feature and disabling it is not recommended. Only install unsigned drivers from trusted sources. Always back up your computer fully before proceeding and ensure you’ve created a recovery drive. An untrusted driver could render your PC unusable without a complete format.\n   \n\nContent\n\n1. Install Unsigned Drivers From Advanced Boot Menu\n2.
