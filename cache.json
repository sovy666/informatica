It's displaying the correct resolution, but seems to think the screen size itself is an inch larger than it actually is, so my mouse and my windows can go about a cm or so offscreen at any given edge. It's really annoying, as maximizing applications will prevent me from seeing their borders. It also looks really ugly, as despite the monitor displaying the correct resolution internally, it's actually displaying a weird, large fraction of the 1440p that it's supposed to (since the borders are cut off) and it looks downscaled.\n This issue did not occur with my previous computer, and my primary monitor is working perfectly fine. Both monitors are 2560x1440. This issue persisted all the way from initial install from the bootable medium, through installation of KDE.\n Possible causes I've thought of:\n  \nI'm using an HDMI cable instead of a DisplayPort cable (I don't have the spare cable to test this, though)\n The monitor is too old for it to report its size to my GPU properly, so it's receiving an incorrect size.\n  \nDoes anyone have any help or suggestions for troubleshooting?\n    submitted by    /u/Psychological-Owl908  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been running a dynamic VFIO GPU passthrough setup for a windows VM for over a year now. I have a 3080 which I use for both passthrough and CUDA compute (when the VM isn't being used), with a 980 as my primary linux display. This configuration is similar to the \"Single GPU Passthrough\" guides (Link to guide), where the target GPU is dynamically unbound from the nvidia driver and rebound to the vfio driver. This setup has been working great until the most recent nvidia driver 515.43. Prior to the update, the nvidia modules could be dynamically unbound (after killing all processes which use the GPU, such as sddm.service and then verifying by running nvidia-smi) using the following commands (and I believe this order mattered):\n ## Load the config file source \"/etc/libvirt/hooks/kvm.conf\" ## Kill KDE systemctl stop sddm.service #Unbind VTconsoles echo 0 > /sys/class/vtconsole/vtcon0/bind echo 0 > /sys/class/vtconsole/vtcon1/bind # Unbind EFI-framebuffer echo efi-framebuffer.0 > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/efi-framebuffer/unbind # Avoid race condition sleep 3 # Unload Nvidia modprobe -r nvidia_drm modprobe -r nvidia_modeset modprobe -r drm_kms_helper modprobe -r nvidia modprobe -r i2c_nvidia_gpu modprobe -r drm modprobe -r nvidia_uvm \n After the update, I am unable to dynamically unbind these modules as they report that the module is still in use and cannot be unbound (essentially running the above commands as su). I am assuming this is an issue with the NVIDIA driver but it could also be the linux kernel (5.17.7-arch1-1) issue as they both were updated at the same time.\n Is anyone else having this problem? For now I have just reverted to a non-dynamic setup where VFIO takes the card at boot, but it looks like those using single GPU passthrough may have issues until this is fixed.\n    submitted by    /u/werdho  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I followed the guide on ArchWiki, but Firefox will not start when LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=nvidia is set. I also tried setting the environment variable MOZ_DISABLE_RDD_SANDBOX=1, but without success. However, Firefox works if I set VDPAU_DRIVER=nvidia and LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=nouveau, but this does not solve the high CPU usage. Did I miss something? Below I posted some relevant information.
