It works under the slightly older version of Bluez currently used by Fedora 35. Any idea of how I can diagnose this? Not really a big deal as my new headset arrives Monday and I can put up with poor sound quality using my backup headset for a couple days.\n    submitted by    /u/unfknpro  \n [link]   [comments]",

One of them has an nvidia graphics card + integrated and the other one just integrated.\n I noticed that the mouse cursor movement is perfect on the nvidia laptop while it looks like a game missing frames on the Intel.\n There's no problem controlling the pointer, it's not jittery, it doesn't stutter, or anything like that. But its movement is definitely not smooth.\n I ask here because googling didn't bring me any answers and I would expect the mouse movement to be smooth, if all desktop effects are (I've compared window animations and those look the same, to me, on both laptops)\n Any ideas?\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/someuser_2  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Almost a year ago I acquired a thinkpad p1 gen 3 from my employer, and of course immediately wiped Windows in favor of Arch with GNOME. As with every install, I wanted to play with what was new in the linux world so I set up my user account using systemd-homed as a BTRFS subvolume (not an encrypted luks loopback). For the most part this has worked out ok. \n Recently, I wanted to set up the fingerprint reader so I installed and enabled fprint. Theoretically this is supposed to enable the fingerprint enrollement UI inside GNOME settings without further configuration. It did not. I was able to register a print with fprint-enroll and the effects are:\n  \nfprint-verify works\n GDM prompts that I can use fingerprint to log in, but attempting to do so always fails\n The GNOME lock screen also prompts that I can use fingerprint to unlock, and that works fairly reliably (the sensor itself seems finicky, which squares with what ive read of others' experience with thinkpad fingerprint readers)\n systemd-ask-password prompts (such as when running a systemctl command without sudo, which display via GNOME UI) do not offer fingerprint authentication, nor does it work if i try to press the sensor anyway\n GNOME settings still shows nothing in relation to fingerprint auth in the user management section \n  \nI've searched around a bit and I haven't been able to find anything about this issue from other users, so I'm hoping someone around here has some experience with this odd combination of fingerprint auth, GNOME and systemd-homed that can provide some insight.\n Fail that, it's quite difficult to figure out where exactly to open an issue with upstream GNOME or what chat channels are available to work through debugging so maybe some pointers there would be helpful.\n tl;dr fprint + systemd-homed doesn't seem to be picked up by GNOME authentication prompts consistently.

I just did a fresh install of Arch Linux (plain arch, not arch-based like Manjaro) and so far everything looks like it's working just fine and I got the AUR installed with the Paru AUR helper. \n Unfortunately I just installed Minecraft Launcher and Prusa Slicer (a 3D printing application) and both of these look like they installed properly, I didn't get any error message of any kind in the terminal, but they don't actually open. When I try to open the desktop icon, they just don't do anything. They don't flash a screen or anything, it's like the icon isn't connected to anything. Minecraft was installed through the AUR and Prusa was installed with regular Pacman. Does anyone know how I might be able to fix this?

          "description": "I installed arch Linux on a laptop with Ly desktop manager and KDE Plasma. Wayland sessions are extremely unstable in my case so I use X11. If I switch to another TTY on a fresh boot without logging into Plasma, I can run systemctl suspend and the laptop sleeps as expected. Once I have Plasma running, systemctl suspend or closing the laptop lid causes the screen to go black but the laptop never enters a suspended state. There is no way that I know to recover the system at this point. Even if I killall plasmashell first, and try to suspend, the problem persists. Plasma power management settings are configured appropriately, so it’s not that simple. Anyone have any tips?\n    submitted by    /u/thursdayjunglist  \n [link]   [comments]",
