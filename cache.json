          "description": "I installed Archlinux last year, and it was a disaster from the start because I was struggling to understand some of the basic concepts. I took time to finally read about the things that were causing me trouble, such as Grub, Sudo, networking and some other random issue.\n FF today, and I was feeling like an imposter on Arch. I began asking myself if I could swim. So I decided, hey; let's try installing to a VM without diving into man or info files except maybe for a reference, and stick with only the Arch User Install guide. Granted, I still need to do some system maintenance.\n I cautiously booted the April Installer in VirtualBox via UEFI mode, and got nervous that maybe it wouldn't work because of vbox issues in the past. I had to choose the EFI image, and then to test, I attempted the archinstall script. This failed when installing packages. I felt defeated for a brief moment, and then remembered that was only to see how it would work. No big deal.\n I then began to follow the Install Guide,which I myself, and many in the Arch community recommend. The time was set, the partitions were made, the system was pacstrapped and it all seemed to go much easier than I recall. Could this work from the first go, I questioned myself? Something must have been done incorrectly, this is not going to work. Having installed LXQt, I ran systemctl enable sddm and hoped for the best.\n Aha, I was greeted with the login screen, and no user listed. I had forgotten a simple useradd So, I switched to tty2 and made the user and rebooted. I then proceeded to boot into my freshly installed Archlinux vm and was presented with the LXQt desktop Environment. There are still many things to do for house cleaning, but this felt like success.\n Don't give up.\n edited for spelling.\n    submitted by    /u/RandomXUsr  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have two 1 TB SSD's on my computer. I have been searching through google for a while now in order to figure out best course of action to utilize this space. Most of the posts I have encountered center around installing on a system with one small root SSD and one bigger home one which does not apply to me. The second SSD can be easily formatted and mounted to be used as a storage space for files but then the package manager does not install packages there when home partition gets full.\n What I planned to do was that one SSD would have boot, swap, root ,home as usual while the other SSD also being included in /home so that it is utilized by the package manager. I don't exactly know if this is possible. In any case, can anyone point me into the right direction to look at to figure it out?\n TL;DR my main goal is that I want my OS to use both drives to install packages, both home partition of the 1st drive and the whole of 2nd drive, kinda like treating it as one.\n    submitted by    /u/LopsidedExperience30  \n [link]   [comments]",

This all started when there was that big firmware update, after update my wi-fi wasn't working, because of a bug. I'm using lvm snapshots so I tried to revert it but it was unsuccessful. Somehow I got kernel mismatch, which is weird because I never had problems like that on my other PC. After that I went in live boot and updated system again. It fixed kernel mismatch. And since then 2 out of 3 updates ended in kernel mismatch.\n I already tried going in live boot and updating again, reverting snapshot. In the latest attempt to update I'm 100% sure boot partition was mounted because mount printed /dev/nvme0n1p1 mounted on /boot/EFI (nvme0n1p1 is boot partition). It was a while ago when I was trying to fix this issue and I forgot everything that I tried. I tried searching ArchWiki and forums and noting helped me. I did however discover that when you are updating your system, that your boot partition needs to be mounted and if you unmount it it should be empty. If I unmount my partition it's not empty (stat initramfs-linux.img shows file was indeed copied there at last update).\n When I try to boot I get:\n  \n[FAILED] failed to start Load Kernel modules.[FAILED] failed to mount /boot/EFI[DEPEND] Dependency failed for Local File System\n  \nThen I get emergency shell.\n journalctl -xb mentions:\n  \n/boot/EFI: unknown filesystem type 'vfat'\n  \ncat /etc/fstab\n  \nUUID=ZE69-C2EC /boot/EFI vfat rw,realtime, .... , errors=remount-ro 0 2\n  \nuname -a\n  \n5.16.10-arch1-1 ...\n  \npacman -Q\n  \n5.17.1.arch1-1\n  \nLast time I updated I gave up trying to fix it because only kernel downgrade worked. Today I tried to update it again since I hoped it would be fixed by update, like the first time, but that didn't happen.\n I'm also using LVM on Luks if this is important.\n Does anyone have any ideas what else I can try or where else can I look for solution?

The main issue is that there is advice on the page that is out of date and is breaking people's Firefox that needs to be amended. I've now dealt with multiple users in /r/firefox who have followed advice on the archwiki and run into this same problem.\n As I'm sure you all know, the captcha requires the output of a pacman command to be run. I understand this is intended to keep the wiki arch-focused, however, at least a significant portion of the wiki is used by the Linux community as a whole and is distro-agnostic. It seems absurd to put up significant barriers in this way, and only serves to lessen the likelihood of the provision of quality documentation for everyone. \n In my view, to just say use the LiveISO, a docker image, install arch, build pacman from source, go hunting for an overlay, or use an online emulator is not a real answer, as people tend to contribute their in spare time, which may be fleeting, causing them to abandon contributing at all.\n Overall, I'm sympathetic to the aim of the captcha, but think it is doing more harm than good.

I'd like to replace PulseAudio with Pipewire, but attempts to add any Pipewire packages leads to conflicts with PulseAudio, which I can't remove as it's needed for something else... and so on.\n Last week I could use speakertest in the terminal, and also play MP3 files using mpg123. Today - remarkably enough - I can still play MP3 files, but I can't use speakertest; I get an error that \n Unable to set hw params for playback: Cannot allocate memory \n Setting of hwparams failed: Cannot allocate memory\n Well, I can live without speakertest. At least I can play MP3s.\n What I can't do though, is get any sound from my browser with streaming services like YouTube. And this is constant across all browsers; at least the ones I've tried. (Chrome, Firefox, Vivaldi.)\n But surely, getting sound working shouldn't be that hard? All I want is for sound to, you know, work.

The server works like it should, I can connect to it from my smartphone or my laptop. On my laptop I imported the wireguard config in network manager. Everything works as expected, it even automatically connects to the VPN after suspend or hibernate and also after disabling and reenabling WiFi in the gnome settings. However as soon as I switch to an different WiFi network NetworkManager goes complete nuts. The nmcli command line program as well as the gnome network settings become completely unresponsive. While I can ping IP addresses with ping and resolve hostnames with nslookup no websites load and trace route gets stuck after some hops. Rebooting fixes the issue. Neighter dmesg nor journalctl give any relevant info, they behave like nothing happened except for ah coredump when gnome-settings crashes. I tried some of the dns related stuff in the wiki like the systemd-resolved symlink or using openresolv but that didn't change a thing. I honestly have no idea where to take it from here.

Il predecessore di Windows 3.1 fu accolto positivamente dall'industria e dagli utenti finali ma mancava di componenti chiave, soffriva di tanti difetti (bug), usava font bitmap e veniva espressamente presentato come una sorta di add-on per MS-DOS.Rendendosi conto della necessità di rimanere competitivi con i Mac di Apple e in vista del salto ai 32 bit con il successivo Windows 95, Microsoft aveva assolutamente necessità di stringere i tempi e rilasciare Windows 3.1 nel più breve tempo possibile.",

È inoltre possibile usare JavaScript come linguaggio di scripting e MonoDevelop come IDE per coloro che vogliono un'alternativa a Visual Studio.Quasi tutto può essere animato con Unity: i creatori di contenuti e gli artisti se ne servono per creare scene 3D o costruire animazioni 2D da zero. Poiché Unity esiste ormai dal 2005 ha potuto raccogliere un enorme seguito di utenti in tutti questi anni e portare a maturazione un'incredibile libreria di risorse.\n\nNella foto Peter Moore, classe 1955.",

When installing Linux in this environment, the GRUB bootloader will overwrite the Windows bootloader within the Master Boot Record (MBR).\n    \nThis is also true in reverse: If you have installed Linux first and then decide to install Windows, the Windows bootloader will overwrite GRUB. You will then find that there is no way to boot into your Linux Desktop.\n    \nLastly, any major change in Windows can also modify your bootloader rendering it unusable. This is the case for the Anniversary Update in Windows 10 and the Windows 11 upgrade.\n    \nAny of these scenarios can be problematic for the new user, but thankfully with a little patience and care, there are ways to restore the bootloader, and in the process, repair the MBR.\n   \n\nContent\n\nRequirements\nBooting into Ubuntu live USB\nMethod One: Boot Repair Utility\nMethod Two: Updating your GRUB Configuration\nMethod Three: Syslinux\nMethod Four: mbr\nMethod Five: LILO\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n.toc{background-color:#f3f4f6;font-size:16px;font-weight:500;padding:1em;}.toc h4{text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase;font-size:0.9375rem;margin-bottom:1rem;}.toc ul{margin:0;padding:0;font-size:15px;}.toc-content{overflow-y:auto;max-height:600px;}.toc-content li{list-style:none!important;margin-bottom:1em;}.toc-content a{color:rgba(74,85,104,var(--text-opacity));text-decoration:none;}.toc-content...
