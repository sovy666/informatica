          "description": "Hey guys!\n (In case you're not interested in reading all this, thing I'd understand, please consider reading my questions at the end)\n I didn't know exactly where to write this question, but here's the thing.\n I've created USB bootables in a lot of ways. I was more used to creating them through interface programs. The fact is, I always used to have some kind of problem when creating them by console.\n Months ago I discovered the Arch wiki, it's been such a blessing to me. I'm learning a lot of topics and thanks to it I find myself improving on Linux.\n But here comes what happened. The other day I was looking how to create a bootable disk on the wiki. After reading on a lot of websites, I got to this line.\n \"Make sure that it is not mounted.\"\n That simple sentence made my mind explode. All these years having issues trying to create a bootable through the console. I've formatted a drive multiple times just to make sure I understood. So I unmount the file system, and then I use some of the commands.\n Conclusion: My problems creating a bootable disk are gone.\n But I'm a curious person, and I always like to understand everything, so... Here I go!\n Questions\n  \nWhy do we need to unmount the file system in order to write the iso to the drive?\n \nWhy does the process usually fail when the file system is mounted?\n \nWhat is happening exactly when I do something like \"cat arch.iso > /dev/sdx\"?\n \nAnd maybe this is a weird question, but why exactly does that work and not \"cat arch.iso > /dev/sdx1\" is it because the .iso file itself is like doing disk1(iso) > disk2(drive)?\n \n I'm still pretty newbie related some Linux things.\n I appreciate your patience just for the fact of reading all this. I look forward to see if I can understand whatever you explain! Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Nuxmin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Many arch users install both a kernel package of their choice and an additional kernel as a sort of \"backup\". This does not provide as much robustness as it could, largely due to what seems like an easily fixable design issue with pacman/dkms/mkinitcpio.\n For example, I have both the linux and linux-lts packages installed, and by default mkinitcpio creates both an autodetect and a fallback initramfs for both kernels, resulting in a total of 4 different images. One would expect that having 4 different initramfs to choose from would provide some robustness against boot issues.\n But it turns out that if you do a full pacman system update, it can apparently remove all the old vmlinuz and initramfs images from /boot/ before generating new ones. This seems to be related to dkms, as the /boot/ images are no longer present after the '70-dkms-install.hook' is invoked, but are only recreated by mkinitcpio after dkms is done (which depending on the number of dkms modules * number of kernels may take a while, e.g. a minute or so). So if your computer crashes during that vulnerable interval between the deletion of all the old /boot/ images at the same time and the generation of the new ones, you will end up with nothing to boot from.\n This issue seems entirely preventable by simply making sure that the /boot/ files are replaced sequentially, i.e. if pacman is called to update two or more kernels at the same time, do not let anything erase the /boot/ files related to two or more kernels simultaneously, but do it one after the other; do not touch any /boot/ files related to the second kernel while the first kernel is getting updated, and only begin updating the images related to the second kernel after the initramfs and vmlinuz images have already been generated for the first.\n    submitted by    /u/rotflol  \n [link]   [comments]",
