          "description": "As of archlinux-keyring 20220713-2, the dependency tree has changed slightly. The package used to be required by pacman, but that's changed with this commit.\n See that commit message for details, but basically that dependency relationship has been reversed, and now archlinux-keyring requires pacman. It was also added to the base-devel group so that on new installs, it comes in explicitly.\n For most people, this will probably pass without note. However, if you're like me and your update script removes package orphans after an install, it'll attempt to remove archlinux-keyring as an orphan. This is because it was installed as a dependency for pacman, but that relationship doesn't exist anymore.\n Needless to say, uninstalling archlinux-keyring would be a Bad Move (tm). If you find yourself in this situation and don't want to accidentally uninstall that package, make sure to mark it as explicitly installed with pacman -D --asexplicit archlinux-keyring. This will imitate the new behavior on new installs, which will have it as explicitly installed when you install the base-devel group.\n EDIT if your installation is newer than October 2019, you probably have the base package and won't have this problem. If you installed before then, and DIDN'T install the base package when it came out, you might hit this issue\n    submitted by    /u/heylookmatt  \n [link]   [comments]",

Quando si usa il portatile spesso si tendono ad assumere posture sconsigliate che se mantenute per un lungo periodo possono portare a dolori e disturbi muscolari alla schiena, al collo e alle braccia.Una posizione comoda nel momento in cui si studia o si lavora è fondamentale soprattutto quando ci si ritrova ad affrontare intense giornate di smartworking o e-learning. Entra così in gioco la scelta del giusto supporto per il notebook e Techly propone due sostegni comodi ed efficaci, dal design semplice e funzionale.Leader nello sviluppo di articoli per l'informatica e l'elettronica, utili e pratici nella quotidianità, Techly propone due supporti PC portatili in grado di soddisfare le esigenze sia di lavoro che di studio in ogni ambiente.Il supporto pieghevole in alluminio ICA-TBL 134TY è largo 16,4 cm e profondo 23,9 cm per garantire compatibilità con una vasta schiera di dispositivi: è adatto a sostenere notebook da 10 a 16 pollici.Il design pieghevole e la struttura in lega leggera d'alluminio lo rendono poco ingombrante e facile da portare con sé grazie alla comoda ed elegante custodia di cui è fornito.Ergonomico e regolabile fino a 6 livelli di angolazione da 0 a 45° (altezza da 5,5 a 15,5 cm), questo supporto per PC portatili consente di posizionare lo schermo al livello più funzionale per aiutare ad assumere la postura più corretta e comoda, prevenendo eventuali mal di schiena, torcicollo o dolore al polso.Il materiale in lega di alluminio da 4 mm e il design aperto e semplice dello stand consentono un'adeguata ventilazione dei dispositivi favorendo la dissipazione del calore.",

          "description": "Sebbene il settore delle memorie 3D NAND stia entrando in un periodo in cui si registra una certa sovrapproduzione con prezzi in calo, le aziende devono necessariamente continuare a innovare.Si chiama NAND una memoria flash non volatile che può cioè conservare i dati anche quando non è connessa a una fonte di energia: le unità SSD, i supporti di memorizzazione esterni USB e le schede SD utilizzano tutti la tecnologia flash per lo storage delle informazioni.In un altro articolo abbiamo parlato ad esempio delle principali differenze tra eMMC, UFS e SSD.Le memorie 3D NAND rappresentano una delle principali innovazioni nel campo dello storage dei dati dell'ultimo decennio. Le tradizionali memorie NAND conservano i dati in celle che sono disposte orizzontalmente, l'una accanto all'altra. Ciò significa che lo spazio è limitato e una riduzione della dimensione fisica di ciascuna cella potrebbe portare a una minore affidabilità.Con la miniaturizzazione sempre più spinta, i produttori si sono trovati in difficoltà accorgendosi che risultava sempre più complesso se non ormai impossibile aumentare la densità dei chip in orizzontale.Con lo schema 3D NAND le celle vengono impilate verticalmente: la maggiore densità di memoria così ottenuta si traduce in una più ampia capacità di storage senza un elevato aumento del prezzo e senza esasperare la riduzione dei nodi di processo.",
