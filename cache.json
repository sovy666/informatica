I'm a CS student who will use arch since I have an Asus laptop that doesn't play nicely with other distros. I'm not an overly security-conscious person but I'm wondering how my arch installation would compare to more common OS like Windows or Mac. I'm using a non privledged user with sudo and have apparmor and firejail enabled, but only with the default profiles. I'm not quite knowledgeable enough to create my own profiles. I also use ufw with the basic ruleset described in the arch wiki. I did some other steps on the arch wiki security page but I didn't want to go too far down the rabbit hole and do anything I don't understand. I've also heard mixed opinions on both apparmor and firejail. Alongside common sense and an adblocker, is this enough basic security? I realize this is largely opinion-based but it's not like I have extremely valuable information on my laptop.\n    submitted by    /u/remdit4me  \n [link]   [comments]",

Il dispositivo dell'utente è a sua volta collegato con una o più carte di debito o di credito attraverso un portafoglio virtuale.Con il sistema attuale Apple non permette a terzi di elaborare pagamenti attraverso il sistema Pay dicendo che diversamente verrebbero meno la sicurezza e la privacy degli utenti.Al termine dell'indagine preliminare, la Commissione spiega di aver contestato ad Apple la sua decisione di impedire agli sviluppatori di app di accedere all'hardware e al software necessari (utilizzo del chip NFC integrato) a vantaggio della sua soluzione per la gestione dei pagamenti, Apple Pay appunto.'Abbiamo rilevato in via preliminare che Apple potrebbe aver limitato la concorrenza a vantaggio della sua soluzione Apple Pay.",

          "description": "Com'è noto sia AMD che NVidia certificano i monitor compatibile con le rispettive tecnologie FreeSync e G-SYNC: si tratta delle soluzioni che introducono il refresh variabile e permettono di 'sincronizzare' il pannello del display con l'uscita della scheda video. I risultati ai quali pervengono AMD e NVidia sono però spesso diversi a causa delle particolarità che contraddistinguono le due tecnologie: ne abbiamo parlato nell'articolo in cui spieghiamo come scegliere monitor per PC.La certificazione AdaptiveSync di VESA offre una 'copertura' completa prendendo in considerazione sia le valutazioni di AMD che di NVidia sia una serie di aspetti addizionali.\n\nLa certificazione VESA è 'aperta' offrendo i risultati di 50 differenti test ai quali sono sottoposti i monitori AdaptiveSync: i vari giudizi includono prove tecniche e visive come flickering, frame drop, jitter, tempi di risposta dei pixel (grey to grey o GaG), ghosting, reverse ghosting e altro ancora.Per essere certificati AdaptiveSync i monitor devono supportare una frequenza di refresh minima pari ad almeno 60 Hz spingendosi fino a 144 Hz.Nel caso della certificazione MediaSync bastano un minimo di 48 Hz e un massimo di almeno 60 Hz: questa 'forbice' è ideale per gestire nella maniera più adeguata la resa di qualunque genere di contenuto multimediale.Anche nel caso di MediaSync lo sfarfallio deve essere assente, sono previsti gli stessi requisiti per evitare il ghosting di AdaptiveSync mentre il jitter deve essere pari a ±0,5 ms per una corretta riproduzione su PC di contenuti multimediali che sono tipicamente registrati a 23,976 Hz (valore che VESA stessa indica come uno 'standard' di fatto per gli studios di Hollywood)..",

È sufficiente toccare i quattro pallini in alto a destra sullo smartphone ovvero avviando sul dispositivo principale dove risulta installato WhatsApp: premendo Dispositivi collegati si può attivare la modalità multidispositivo che abilita l'utilizzo dell'app di messaggistica anche quando il telefono fosse spento, in modalità aereo o fuori copertura (WiFi e rete dati dell'operatore di telefonia mobile).Gli sviluppatori di WhatsApp stanno lavorando per abbattere anche l'ultimo muro rimasto: a breve l'applicazione potrà essere installata su un secondo smartphone oppure su un tablet e utilizzata in maniera del tutto indipendente rispetto al device principale.Anche se al momento non si conosce la data di rilascio della nuova funzionalità, l'attesa non dovrebbe essere lunga perché la presenza dell''inedita' caratteristica è stata avvistata da WABetaInfo in una delle più recenti versioni di anteprima di WhatsApp.Non sappiamo ancora come sarà tradotta in italiano ma toccando Register device as companion sarà possibile aggiungere un secondo smartphone o tablet.La configurazione sembra simile a quella che adesso permette l''accoppiamento' di nuovi dispositivi scegliendo Dispositivi collegati: bisognerà inquadrare il codice QR mostrato sul display dell'altro telefono e autorizzare l'operazione.",
