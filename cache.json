          "description": "I’ve been trying to learn more about using and manipulating Linux since getting a Steam Deck. So before trying this I had practically no knowledge of Linux usage except what sudo meant. My first challenge to myself was to get GBStudio v.3.0.3 to run on the deck so I can create on the go. \n From the itch.io link, I can get an Ubuntu/Debian package, or a Fedora/Red Hat package. I went with the .deb package because I saw more info online for it.\n I decided the easiest way to do all this was with AUR (Arch User Repository). And then using YAY (Yet Another Yogurt). Which is a Pacman wrapper and AUR helper.\n This would supposedly allow me to wrap the .deb package into something more palatable for the Steam Deck to install.\n Starting by allowing the Decks read only to be written. I’m iffy on that…",

          "description": "Hi Everyone, Sorry if this isn't exactly the right spot, but I just need some pointers more than a concrete solution. I've got both KDE 5.24 and GNOME 42 installed on my Arch system, largely because of GNOME's more mature Wayland implementation. All arch packages are up to date, systemd is version 251, and I'm using the latest ZEN kernel, 5.17.9.\n These DE's seem to play poorly together, with GNOME the more affected party. Perhaps notably, my login/startup is SDDM, not GDM, since I had installed KDE first.\n In both\n opening a terminal gives the message:\n discover_other_daemon: 1% \n which I think is the clue that things are duplicated.\n On GNOME: The KDE wallet system always opens at startup, and the akonadi server processes all run in the background. Further, the KDE demon runs in the background; if I log out or shutdown, it warns me that I will also log out... myself, but that's presumably my username \"logged in\" on a KDE session.\n Theming on GNOME seems to be seriously impacted, in that only my legacy app theme -- the one I can set in KDE, fwiw -- respected, whereas all other GTK apps, including all those that are part of GNOME itself, completely ignoring my theming, darkmode preferences, etc. Changing config files doesn't seem to do anything, nor does completely deleting them, even.\n Any Ideas about what to try? I think if I can find a way to make KDE services and daemons only launch if a KDE desktop session is started by me would probably solve all the troubles, though I don't know what troubles that might cause for KDE.\n    submitted by    /u/Watership_of_a_Down  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I found out about the --batchinstall option to yay \n  \nWhen building and installing AUR packages instead of installing each package after building, queue each package for install. Then once either all packages are built or a package in the build queue is needed as a dependency to build another package, install all the packages in the install queue.\n  \nIt solves some issues I get when trying to do zfs upgrades so I wanted to add it to my yay config file so it always does a batch install. Is there any problem that come could up if I always use it? It seems like a good option but it's not the default so there could be some downside to it so is there a time you wouldn't want to add --batchinstall?\n    submitted by    /u/Status-Floor3119  \n [link]   [comments]",

It seems to involve a lot of clicking links to read referencing articles towards the end. Google led me to a few articles that were really helpful and some that weren't. Either they skimed over the parts I needed further clarification on or they just didnt cover it at all.\n The part I really struggled on was installing a bootloader. I tried grub my first few tries and had forgot to mount the boot partition to /boot/EFI (I'm installing as practice for my bare metal PC, which uses UEFI). I had only mounted it to /boot. So I kept getting errors I just couldn't figure out.\n I switched over and tried installing systemd-boot. I think I might've been making the same mistake again as I just couldn't seem to get systemd-boot to work either. I tried with systemd-boot twice before I gave up. \n I woke up this morning and read this super handy how-to from It's FOSS (https://itsfoss.com/install-arch-linux/) that walked me through the grub install. I felt like I understood where I went wrong so I booted up a VM and started another attempt. I got to the bootloader part, followed the article to the letter, exit chroot and reboot. I swear I did a little prayer as it was rebooting. The second I saw that grub menu, I almost jumped!\n Anyway, sorry for the long and pretty pointless post 😂🤣 Just celebrating a moment!\n    submitted by    /u/kantoking0206  \n [link]   [comments]",

They are as follows:\n 10-monitor.conf:\n Section \"Monitor\" Identifier \"DP-4\" Modeline \"1920x1080_144.00\" 452.50 1920 2088 2296 2672 1080 1083 1088 1177 -hsync +vsync Option \"Primary\" \"true\" Option \"PreferredMode\" \"1920x1080_144.0\" EndSection Section \"Monitor\" Identifier \"HDMI-0\" Modeline \"1920x1080_75.00\" 220.75 1920 2064 2264 2608 1080 1083 1088 1130 -hsync +vsync Option \"LeftOf\" \"DP-4\" Option \"PreferredMode\" \"1920x1080_74.97\" EndSection \n 20-nvidia.conf:\n Section \"Device\" Identifier \"Device0\" Driver \"nvidia\" VendorName \"NVIDIA Corporation\" Option \"monitor-HDMI-1\" \"HDMI-1\" Option \"monitor-DisplayPort-4\" \"DP-4\" EndSection \n I also have tried renaming 20-nvidia.conf to 05-device.conf as instructed in this article of the Arch Wiki, that also didn't help.\n Any help would be appreciated.

Sappiamo che lo sviluppo del dispositivo potrebbe essere cominciato già un paio di anni fa, che utilizza - come accennato nell'introduzione - l'interfaccia HDMI e che può essere quindi collegato a qualunque monitor e televisore. Gli appassionati di gaming potranno utilizzare i loro videogiochi preferiti senza bisogno di una console.Keystone potrebbe utilizzare un sistema operativo Windows o Xbox ridotto: il nome Keystone è infatti comparso in un elenco di piattaforme Microsoft non basate sull'utilizzo di Android.L'adozione di un sistema basato su Windows anziché su Android consentirebbe a Microsoft di offrire le proprie app per lo streaming multimediale come 'Film e TV' anche se la scelta del robottino verde sarebbe forse più ovvia e naturale.",

          "description": "A fine aprile 2022 il ricercatore Mor Davidovich ha individuato un metodo per acquisire privilegi SYSTEM su qualunque sistema Windows collegato a un dominio.Davidovich ha spiegato di aver 'assemblato' il codice proveniente da diversi tool preesistenti per sviluppare un'applicazione (KrbRelayUp), pubblicata su GitHub, che conente a un utente di acquistare privilegi che non gli competono.In un altro articolo abbiamo visto le differenze tra i privilegi SYSTEM e i diritti di amministratore in Windows.L'aspetto più rilevante della ricerca condotta da Davidovich è che l'acquisizione dei privilegi SYSTEM sui sistemi utilizzati in ambito aziendale funziona anche con la configurazione predefinita del dominio. L'esperto in un primo tempo ha fatto presente che l'attacco KrbRelayUp non andava in porto nel caso in cui l'amministratore di sistema avesse attivato la firma LDAP su Windows Server.Lunedì scorso Davidovich ha rilasciato una nuova versione del suo tool KrbRelayUp che porta all'ottenimento dei privilegi più elevati anche con firma LDAP abilitata.Pur confermando l'esistenza della problematica, Microsoft si è affrettata a precisare che l'attacco in questione non interessa i clienti che usano istanze di Azure Active Directory.KrbRelayUp può comunque aiutare eventuali aggressori a compromettere macchine virtuali Azure in ambienti Active Directory ibridi in cui i controller di dominio sono sincronizzati con Azure Active Directory.In una pagina di supporto appena pubblicata, Microsoft ha condiviso le metodologie per proteggersi dall'attacco KrbRelayUp.In generale, i tecnici dell'azienda di Redmond suggeriscono di attivare la firma LDAP, Extended Protection for Authentication (EPA) e impostare a 0 l'attributo MS-DS-Machine-Account-Quota.Una dimostrazione dell'attacco è stata pubblicata in questo post su Twitter..",
