          "description": "After having the issue plague me for 5 months, I finally figured out the fix. The issue is that monitors by default uses automatic settings for its Broadcast RGB Range where sometime it's incorrectly set to Limited Broadcast RGB Range (16-235 instead of 0-255, more info here) resulting in washed out colours making the deepest black looking greyish and white not as bright etc. In my case, it's because I'm using Intel iGPU (laptop) with an external monitor connected via HDMI to USB C thunderbolt port.\n ​\n The solution is easy on xorg with xrandr:\n xrandr --output auto --set \"Broadcast RGB\" \"Full\" \n ​\n For Wayland there wasn't much info online so it was quite difficult to find the solution: Use (libdrm) proptest to overide 'Broadcast RGB' from automatic (0) to full (1) for your specific monit…",

It naturally wont load Xorg as the driver is bound to vfio-pci. I don't get any output on card 2 once UEFI has handed over to the arch EFI image.\n How can I force the early arch boot process to use card 2 and ignore card 1? \n I tried setting video=DP-1:e in the kernel cmd line as per https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kernel_mode_setting but it did not help.\n    submitted by    /u/allocx  \n [link]   [comments]",

However the arch installation media does not work either.\n I am aware of the grub kernel parameters and kernal mode settings, but I do not have much experience with them. It seems people have had this problem before and the solution is to add \"nomodeset\" as a kernel parameter. This however does nothing for me. The screen continues to go black after adding new valid and invalid parameters.\n I have also tried running the installation media with a BIOS boot, but my keyboards do not work in the arch menu for bios boot.

Amazon ha annunciato oggi che Drive chiuderà i battenti alla fine del 2023.Presentato come servizio di archiviazione cloud sicuro per i clienti Amazon al fine di effettuare il backup dei propri file, Drive offre 5 GB di spazio gratis per tutti gli utenti e la possibilità di accedere da Web oltre che tramite app Android e iOS.L'abbandono di Amazon Drive si concretizzerà attraverso una serie di tappe successive: il 31 ottobre 2022 Amazon rimuoverà le app Drive dagli store di Google ed Apple mentre dal 31 gennaio 2023 non saranno più accettati nuovi caricamenti di file sul cloud. Dal 31 dicembre 2023 gli utenti di Amazon Drive non potranno più visualizzare o scaricare i contenuti conservati sui server dell'azienda guidata da Jeff Bezos.Amazon suggerisce a tutti coloro che si servono del servizio Drive di scaricare i dati in locale prima di questa data limite.Nel caso in cui gli utenti dovessero incontrare difficoltà nel download di file pesanti oppure di un gran numero di elementi memorizzati su Amazon Drive, i tecnici della società suggeriscono di ricorrere al client desktop di Amazon Photos: esso consente di scaricare più di 5 GB o 1.000 file per volta.L'abbandono di Amazon Drive non avrà alcun effetto su Amazon Photos, il servizio che consente di archiviare sul cloud foto e video.Per gli abbonati Amazon Prime è assicurato il caricamento di un numero illimitato di foto, di qualunque peso e con qualsiasi risoluzione.Per approfondire, Amazon ha pubblicato una pagina contenente le risposte alle domande frequenti sulla chiusura di Drive e le istruzioni per recuperare per tempo i propri dati..",

Il fatto è che trovare prodotti che sappiano coniugare la qualità con il prezzo non è affatto semplice.La bici elettrica pieghevole NIUBILITY B16 con motore da 350W, 36V, batteria da 10,4 Ah e velocità massima pari a 25 km/h è un prodotto davvero molto interessante, peraltro realizzato da un'azienda da anni specializzata in questa tipologia di oggetti.NIUBILITY B16 è disponibile al prezzo scontato di 479,99 euro con spedizione dai magazzini europei del venditore. Per ottenere lo sconto promozionale è necessario digitare il codice coupon TCNYTB al momento dell'invio dell'ordine.\n\nRealizzata in lega di alluminio, NIUBILITY B16 pesa circa 20 kg, dispone di ruote stabili da 16 pollici e misura 137 x 24 x 113 cm una volta aperta (78 x 35 x 65 cm quando ripiegata su se stessa).NIUBILITY B16 può essere utilizzata in due diverse modalità tra le quali c'è anche la pedalata assistita.Stando a quanto dichiarato dal produttore, la batteria da 10,4 Ah offre un'autonomia di circa 40-50 km con una singola ricarica (che richiede 4-6 ore).Il motore elettrico brushless da 350W è silenzioso e, grazie alla sua posizione, offre un ottimo bilanciamento della bici contribuendo ad assicurare una stabilità ancora maggiore.",
