I'm experiencing a problem with waking the computer from lid-closed sleep, where the computer wakes but the screen is black, except for a small horizontal line at the topmost left corner of the screen. The keyboard won't respond in this state, so I can't get another terminal open to diagnose or kill the display manager. \n Arch is otherwise running perfectly on the P50, but this issue is really annoying and I would love to resolve it. The problem is that I don't know where to start, and would really appreciate some guidance / tips from the community. I perused the forums and reddit, and couldn't find a post with the same issue - but I am sure that this is not unique to me. I'm running 5.18.13-arch1-1. No display manager is used; just a call to exec dwm in .xinitrc. \n I can provide whatever logging info would be helpful. I have the same build running on a Thinkpad X220, and that installation is bullet proof - so I wonder if it has to do with the hybrid graphics setup on the P50? I have the following graphics drivers installed: mesa, lib32-mesa, nvidia.\n Thanks again.\n    submitted by    /u/Away_Inflation_411  \n [link]   [comments]",

A2DP has always worked great for listening to music and videos but obviously I needed to switch to HFP in order for the microphone to work. I'm using pulseaudio and was able to enable the HFP profile pretty painlessly with pavcontrol.\n This was fine until a couple of weeks ago, now my system is showing unavailable in `pactl list`:\n Profiles: a2dp_sink: High Fidelity Playback (A2DP Sink) (sinks: 1, sources: 0, priority: 40, available: yes) handsfree_head_unit: Handsfree Head Unit (HFP) (sinks: 1, sources: 1, priority: 30, available: no) off: Off (sinks: 0, sources: 0, priority: 0, available: yes) \n I followed the steps in the wiki relating to HFP issues. But I'm at a bit of a dead end. I tried running:\n dbus-send --print-reply --system --dest=org.ofono /phonesim org.ofono.Modem.SetProperty string:\"Powered\" variant:boolean:true \n With the error\n Error org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.UnknownObject: Method \"SetProperty\" with signature \"sv\" on interface \"org.ofono.Modem\" doesn't exist \n So I checked to make sure I have activated the modem, but downloading the git repo for ofono and running test/list-modems just creates a draggable text area on my screen for some reason, then exits out.\n I then went and checked the python code and ran the first couple of lines:\n import dbus bus = dbus.SystemBus() manager = dbus.Interface(bus.get_object('org.ofono', '/'),'org.ofono.Manager') modems = manager.GetModems() print(modems) >>> dbus.Array([], signature=dbus.Signature('(oa{sv})')) \n So looks like modems is empty and I'm not sure where to go from here?\n Any help much appreciated.\n Also curious why the headset is only recently not working, have had no similar issues on my phone.\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/jzia93  \n [link]   [comments]",

I suoni sono comunque attivabili su richiesta anche in questi sistemi operativi.Con il lancio di Windows 11, di default il sistema riproduce un jingle di pochi istanti.La curiosità è che nelle attuali versioni stabili di Windows 11 quell'effetto sonoro è salvato sotto forma di file audio con un bitrate di 2304 kbps mentre con il futuro Windows 11 22H2 sarà ridotto a 1536 kbps, esattamente come la maggior parte dei file WAV di sistema usati nello storico e indimenticabile Windows 95.",
