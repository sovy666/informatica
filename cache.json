And when I install a group, it is equivalent to install the individual packages, meaning the groups concept is more of a syntactic sugar, not much more than that. If that's all true, then I have a problem below:\n In abstract terms, if I install group G, which includes packages a, b, c, the three packages will be installed and marked as explicit by default. Now after some evolution package a dropped out of group G. All good, except that upgrades do not automatically remove a, even if it is not depended by any other installed packages, since it was marked explicit. If I remove group G, a would not be removed either since it is not in that group anymore.\n In reality, I think this was what happened when tracker-miner (the a above) package was removed from group gnome (G above) last week. After I did pacman -Rnsc gnome, package tracker-miner was still there.\n It makes me think package group (such as base-devel, gnome) approach is inferior to a meta-package (such as base).

I am new to linux and I have a friend who is using arch linux for 2 years but we are unable do dual-GPU setup with amd as iGPU for display and NVIDIA for other stuff like games. I need help with this and is it even possible to keep amd for display and nvidia for other things? \n also, I had a question. When my friend helped me setup only nvidia gpu for everything from arch-wiki. It was working great for few hours and then suddenly my DE starts to lag alot (stutter). I am having this problem for a long time. I switched to arch a while ago too, I had the same problem. So, I had to switch back to windows 10 for sometime. does anybody know what was the reason of this issue? \n Thanks in advance guys.\n Have a nice day!\n    submitted by    /u/massiar  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know that battery life on Linux is not that great but on my laptop I can barely get 2 hours of battery life tops. Therefore I am looking at ways to increase my battery life.\n Since I only use my GPU for some CUDA programing, I was planning to turn it off when I am not using it. For this I am using PRIME. I modified /etc/udev/rules.d/80-nvidia-pm.rules and /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia-pm.conf as per the instructions on archwiki. However, even after this, I am unable to get better battery life. I am also running auto-cpufreq improve the battery life further. While I was investigating this issue, I decided to check if my GPU was really off or not.\n Here the screenshot of nvidia-smi and here is the screenshot of nvtop. I think these screenshots indicate that Xorg is running on the NVIDIA GPU and not on integrated graphics.\n Also I am using i3blocks's GPU block to view the usage. Could this be the reason why my GPU is always active?\n So, can anybody tell me how can I force Xorg to use the integrated graphics instead of the dedicated GPU so that I may be able to increase my battery life.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/pr0_Disappointment  \n [link]   [comments]",

Rilasciando entrambi i tasti, Windows passerà automaticamente alla visualizzazione della finestra corrispondente alla selezione.Per selezionare le miniature delle app in senso inverso basta premere anche il tasto MAIUSC (MAIUSC+ALT+TAB).Ma non è necessario complicarsi la vita: dopo aver premuto ALT+TAB basta premere le frecce direzionali sulla tastiera (destra/sinistra, su/giù) per spostarsi all'interno della schermata e scegliere la finestra desiderata.\n\nPer aprire la schermata che in Windows 10 e Windows 11 permette di passare da una finestra all'altra senza tenere premuto alcun tasto, si può premere CTRL+ALT+TAB (basta insomma aggiungere la pressione del tasto CTRL): in questo modo le miniature resteranno a video anche rilasciando tutti tre i tasti.",

Vengono comunque utilizzati alcuni dei componenti software alla base del funzionamento di Windows Update for Business per gestire gli aggiornamenti.Windows Autopatch non può essere utilizzato nell'ambito di domini locali Active Directory ma solo ed esclusivamente con Azure AD, anche in configurazione ibrida. Si rivolge quindi agli utenti in possesso di una licenza Windows 10/11 Enterprise E3 o superiore ed è gratuito.In un video pubblicato su YouTube Microsoft illustra i passaggi necessari per attivare Windows Autopatch: è necessario effettuare il login su Endpoint Manager come amministratore globale quindi cercare Windows Autopatch nel menu principale.Dopo aver configurato un tenant in Azure AD, Windows Autopatch suddivide automaticamente i dispositivi usati in azienda in quattro gruppi indicati da Microsoft come 'rings', 'anelli' in italiano.",
