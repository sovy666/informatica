          "description": "I'm not sure where this bug originates: if it's in rsync, zsh, some plugin for zsh or the arch packaging of any of these, but there's a problem with the auto-complete when auto-completing remote paths while rsyncing between my two arch machines. I seems to stem from a recent change in rsync behaviour I think.\n Before you had to prepend \\\\ to all your escapes when dealing with remote files in rsync, this in order to send the escapes to the remote machine. So if you had a machine machine with a file my file you wanted to copy, you would use rsync -Parch machine:my\\\\\\ file ..\n However now I get an error saying rsync: [sender] link_stat \"/home/machine/my\\ file\" failed: No such file or directory (2), and the way to fix it is to remove the escaped \\: rsync -Parch machine:my\\ file ..\n Anyone else have this problem? Is there a way to fix this?\n    submitted by    /u/qhxo  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been getting the strangest issue where all of sudden my system forgets it's a system? If I have back open and try to run a command it will return:\n bash: ls: command not found\n And even though I can still use mouse and keyboard, I cannot call dmenu or summon a new terminal or anything. I am scratching my head. Checking my logs I don't see anything obvious, though I'm not sure where to look as I have no idea what's going on?\n I've been trying to get a game to run in steam using different versions of proton, and wound up installing pipx and then installing protontricks. I still haven't gotten the game to work, and I'm not sure if it's related. But it's driving me nuts.\n And last night I was watching a video in vlc and it froze, the whole computer was unresponsive, for about 30 seconds, then it just went back to normal. This happened twice more. \n I'm having some issues with the keyboard, so I'm wondering if it's a software problem or not? If it's hardware, how would I check? I'm really at a loss here.\n    submitted by    /u/undeadalex  \n [link]   [comments]",

A stretto rigore, un'unità viene dapprima inizializzata ovvero predisposta a livello logico con la creazione di una o più partizioni secondo un preciso schema di partizionamento (GPT o MBR).Le partizioni di hard disk, SSD e unità rimovibili vengono utilizzate per suddividere i dati. In una partizione, ad esempio, si può installare il sistema operativo mentre l'altra accoglierà i dati.Nel caso di molti sistemi operativi vengono create, sullo stesso supporto, una partizione che si occupa di gestire la procedura di avvio mentre in un'altra vengono salvati i file che fanno funzionare il sistema vero e proprio (e che vengono caricati successivamente).",
