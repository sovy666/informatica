          "description": "Greetings Arch Community,\n I've been running Gnome for a couple releases now (since ~3.30), and while performance improves with each new release, which I'm always very grateful for, it always feels like there is still room for some improvement. There can be the occasional lag/stutter with animations, like going in/out of Overview mode or going in/out of the App Drawer for example. This is noticeable not just on Arch, but on other distros I've tested like Fedora, PopOS, Solus, etc, so it's not unique to just Arch, but more so to the Gnome DE and quite possibly my hardware too. \n I have an Acer Aspire E5-576G laptop, which has an Nvidia MX150/Intel hybrid setup, currently setup with EnvyControl, using the latest nvidia-dkms driver, to use the Nvidia GPU as the primary since I'm always connected to a power source. Since it's Nvidia, I still need to use Xorg for a majority of my workflow. I do like to test out Wayland every so often, but my default still needs to be Xorg for now.\n I'm currently using mutter v42.2-1 as my window manager, but I've noticed there are two other options available in the AUR: mutter-performance and mutter-dynamic-buffering\n I'm curious if these packages could offer any significantly noticeable improvement(s) under Xorg or if the gains are negligible under Xorg. \n I'm wondering for any other Nvidia and/or Xorg users out there that have tried either of these two AUR packages, how your experience has been and if you recommend one package over the other for any reason(s)? Would appreciate any feedback so I have an idea what to expect before I can test them out. My understanding is it looks like the patches work better under Wayland than Xorg, so I appreciate any comments from others that have already tried either of these patches, thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/dswhite85  \n [link]   [comments]",

Everything stays.\n Installing packages and creating files is also possible without problems. The system will auto-expand at boot to the size of your stick. Usage as a hybrid rescue system / portable storage is possible.\n Creating the disk image yourself is very easy, if you are running an Arch Linux system. How to do that is explained on github.\n This is how you can place it on a stick:\n  wget https://github.com/flying-dude/efly/releases/download/latest/efly-live.img sudo cp efly-live.img /dev/sdX # replace sdX with the device node of your stick \n If you want to run it inside a VM, you need to truncate first:\n  wget https://github.com/flying-dude/efly/releases/download/latest/efly-live.img truncate --size=10G efly-live.img git clone https://github.com/flying-dude/efly efly/scripts/efly-qemu --uefi efly-live.img \n This is brand-new but so far it works really well.

          "description": "I've been using secure boot with systemd to auto-decrypt my LUKS system partition on boot for about a year on all my bare metal arch systems, but my headless server has been having issues since 251.1-1 was installed. My desktop and laptop auto-decrypt just fine. BIOS version hasn't changed between systemd updates. It's using AMD fTPM.\n 251.2-1 hit my server but the issue continues. When systemd-boot reaches the disk decryption for root, it takes 5 seconds to run two cryptsetup jobs (without error) to decrypt as if it's working, but then prompts for a passphrase. If I wipe the TPM2 slot, it skips that 2-job step and instantly prompts for passphrase. Entering the passphrase will allow the boot to continue successfully.\n I'm using PCRs 0 and 7, and they have the exact same values after each boot according to tpm2_pcrread.\n I tried enrolling with option --tpm2-with-pin=no, clearing TPM from BIOS, enabling all sha1 and sha256 banks, wiping tpm2 cryptenroll slots and turning TPM off + power cycling and setting it all up again but still no progress. It's always the same 5 sec cryptsetup jobs that results in a LUKS passphrase prompt. My systemd-boot entry hasn't changed since I first set it up, and the rd.luks options are all the exact same from when it worked before.\n Tried to re-cryptenroll the root by sdX and by-uuid. A secondary storage disk decrypts using crypttab just fine (using keyfile, not TPM).\n Output of bootctl status seems good:\n System: Firmware: UEFI 2.70 (American Megatrends 5.17) Secure Boot: enabled (user) TPM2 Support: yes Boot into FW: supported Current Boot Loader: Product: systemd-boot 251.2-1-arch \n I can't find any related errors in journalctl, where else could I troubleshoot this issue?\n    submitted by    /u/Terry-51C  \n [link]   [comments]",

Questo a partire dal 2023.Al momento i requisiti per l'installazione di Windows 11 non obbligano a usare un SSD ma anche gli utenti potrebbero essere presto esortati ad accantonare gli hard disk.Allo stato attuale Microsoft si limita a rimarcare che funziona…",

Le prestazioni migliori, con concreti vantaggi anche in termini di riduzione della latenza, dei consumi energetici e miglioramento della sicurezza, sono garantite dalle reti 5G Standalone (5G SA) capaci di autosostenersi senza dipendere da nessun'altra tecnologia sottostante.Le aziende impegnate nella progettazione e produzione dei dispositivi per le telecomunicazioni stanno nel frattempo già guardando avanti tanto che sono iniziati i primi test per creare network 6G: essi permetteranno di sviluppare reti mobili di sesta generazione con una velocità di trasmissione dati fino a 100.000 volte superiore al massimo teorico del 5G.NTT DOCOMO, il principale operatore di telecomunicazioni mobili del Giappone, la sua società madre NTT, NEC, Fujitsu e Nokia sono stati incaricati dei primi test relativi alla prossima generazione di reti mobili.Ma sarà del tutto inutile disporre di tecnologie 6G a livello di singole celle se l'infrastruttura sottostante non sarà in grado di offrire una larghezza di banda sufficiente.",

Perché il cofondatore del progetto Vivaldi, l'islandese Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner, presentò il nuovo browser nel 2015-2016 dopo aver abbandonato il ruolo di CEO in Opera Software. A suo tempo parlammo di Vivaldi come il nuovo browser del padre di Opera.Vivaldi non è completamente open source: essendo un browser derivato da Chromium, tutte le modifiche applicate vengono sempre rese di pubblico dominio.Il browser utilizza però componenti di terze parti e un'esclusiva interfaccia utente che gli sviluppatori non vogliono vedere in prodotti derivati.",

          "description": "Le eSIM rappresentano la versione virtuale della SIM tradizionale. Anziché avere a che fare con un chip su supporto plastico da inserire in uno slot, con una eSIM è possibile abilitare lo smartphone a comunicare sulla rete dati di uno specifico operatore e con piano tariffario 'ad hoc' semplicemente scansionando un codice QR. I dati della eSIM vengono infatti memorizzati all'interno del dispositivo, in un chip saldato sul circuito integrato.In passato abbiamo visto nel dettaglio cos'è una eSIM e come funziona: con il lancio di iOS 16 Apple offre la possibilità di trasferire le eSIM da un iPhone all'altro via Bluetooth.Per attivare il trasferimento delle eSIM è necessario che l'iPhone 'di destinazione' abbia il modulo Bluetooth attivo, sia sbloccato e che, ovviamente, sia fisicamente nelle immediate vicinanze.Perché la procedura vada a buon fine è necessario che l'operatore di telefonia mobile supporti il trasferimento delle sue eSIM da un telefono all'altro.Al momento ciò è tutt'altro che scontato dal momento che iOS 16 è stato appena presentato in veste definitiva e la funzione per spostare le eSIM da un iPhone all'altro è ancora in 'beta'.Gli iPhone XS e successivi supportano una singola eSIM mentre tutti i modelli di iPhone 13 assicurano l'utilizzo di una configurazione dual eSIM.Anche Google sta spingendo l'acceleratore sul supporto eSIM: Android 13 permette di effettuare connessioni multiple anche con un solo chip eSIM.",

Ecco perché il problema della quadratura del cerchio non è risolvibile: non è possibile costruire un quadrato di area esattamente corrispondente a quella di un cerchio.

Scrivendo chrome://discards nella barra degli indirizzi si ottengono informazioni sullo stato di ciascuna scheda visualizzata nel browser.Allo stesso modo, scrivendo edge://discards nella barra degli indirizzi di Edge si ottengono informazioni molto simili anche se il criterio usato è differente.Parlando dei migliori browser per la gestione della memoria e delle schede aperte abbiamo visto che la funzione che si occupa di eliminare dalla RAM il contenuto delle schede inutilizzate si chiama Schede in sospensione.Accedendo alle impostazioni di Edge e cliccando su Sistema e prestazioni, si può notare come il browser ponga in sospensione le schede aperte dopo circa 5 minuti di inutilizzo.",
