I'm trying to set up my Arch installation so that pressing the PrtScr key will open an interactive screenshot prompt to allow me to select a portion of the screen. I'm using the Budgie desktop environment with gnome-screenshot.\n On the surface, this sounds easy—according to the keyboard shortcuts, I just press the PrtScr key (image)!\n But pressing the PrtScr key takes a full-screen screenshot (with a white border flash and saving to Pictures). And disabling that shortcut doesn't change anything—it still takes a full-screen screenshot and saves it to Pictures. \n If I uninstall gnome-screenshot, it stops taking screenshots when I press PrtScr. But when I assign the PrtScr button to any other shortcuts (for example, to launch Flameshot, another screenshot utility), nothing happens when I press it.\n So my problem is that: \n  \nWhen gnome-screenshot is installed, I can only use PrtScr to take a full-screen screenshot.\n When gnome-screenshot is uninstalled, I can't use PrtScr for any other shortcuts.\n  \nDoes anybody know what's going on here?\n    submitted by    /u/TheKingElessar  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was succesful in reverting both the locale.gen and locale.conf using a text editor and a hex editor, respectivelly.\n After reboot the UI reverted back to English but i still cannot launch the terminal.

For any future folks, you're not going to brick anything.]\n Hi all!\n I'm trying to install Arch on a Chromebook, using the install guide.\n So far I have installed SeaBIOS via Mr Chromebox script. Not sure whether I've overwritten Chrome OS / its loader, but I feel like I may have.\n At the point I am now, the guide says I should be partitioning my disk. However, my disk already has partitions- twelve of them, in fact. Looking stuff up to see whether I can delete them has confused me. I hear that I might remove a bootloader, or I might accidentally brick my computer.\n Here is what comes from running fdisk -l (apologies that I can't screenshot and then upload, for obvious reasons :B)\n Any advice on the next step to take would be appreciated. I am 100% fine and in fact wanting to remove Chrome OS itself from the computer. All I know is that I cannot proceed without doing something, as I cannot \"install essential packages\" due to lack of space in my partition.\n Thank you in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/sunsetkite  \n [link]   [comments]",
