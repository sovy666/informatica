Tray icons of non-plasma programs didn't show up, plasma-nm (even if it wasn't updated) couldn't connect to any openvpn connection (it worked with openvpn XY.conf via the terminal), opening a file from dolphin took ages and I couldn't switch my keyboard layouts anymore from the panel nor my global shortcuts.\n I did checked the logs, but I couldn't find any errors, I checked the arch bug tracker of all kde programs I've upgraded, but I couldn't find any bug. I reset my panels and set them up again, but it didn't change anything for me, I tired a wayland session, which did allow me to change the keyboard layout again, but didn't solve any of the other problems.\n However, as I had to get back to work, I downgraded all my packages via the arch archive to 2022-05-12 (the time I ran the last time updates) and since then everything runs smooth.\n Here the list of packages I've upgraded today (and now downgraded): https://pastebin.com/GZq8AF2n\n Do you guys experience the same problems?

          "description": "Oh boy I hope I don't get removed. I will try to keep it short. Look into gentoo installation guide, everything is elaborated. It explains everything in one page. I learned to install arch just via watching youtube videos and reading the gentoo wiki. The installation guide for example, does not explain on how to make new mount points. It simply touches on the command and link it to another page. An linux user using ubuntu, fedora, or anything similar will may have never learned how to make new folders. Arch Linux expects you to know that. If you don't they simply link it to the main page of the particular command. One example is on gentoo wiki about the filesystems they elaborate a small para about the basics of the filesystem. Then they link it to the main page if you want to read more. You could install gentoo without the need to go to another page in the wiki. In arch wiki you need to go through atleast 10 different pages to be able to have a working system. The solution is they need to elaborate more on certain topics like what is EFI partition, certain commands.\n PS - hello\n EDIT- Thanks for downvoting\n    submitted by    /u/imnotpathetic  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As far as I know, when rust binaries are built their dependencies are downloaded and built into the executable. I'm a fan of having all binaries link to shared libraries instead, in order to be able to fix all instances of a given vulnerability with a single package upgrade instead of worrying about whether they have propagated to every dependent executable I use.\n In practice, does the package of a rust binary leave me open to vulnerabilities longer than a package that links to everything dynamically would? I would love to get some packagers' perspective on this as well. Do you see issues with this dependency handling approach? Your experience from other languages might also be relevant if they use the same model.\n EDIT: adding another question; those of you who do consider it a security concern, do you abstain from using programs written in rust or do you find the risk acceptable in order to use the apps you like?\n    submitted by    /u/patatahooligan  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm not entirely sure how to describe this issue in a way a search engine would understand, and I haven't done enough troubleshooting to ask the forums without getting someone annoyed at me, so I'm posting here to ask if anyone else has had the same issue as me:\n I just build a new pc with a modern graphics card, but my second monitor is attempting to display a screen larger than itself. It's displaying the correct resolution, but seems to think the screen size itself is an inch larger than it actually is, so my mouse and my windows can go about a cm or so offscreen at any given edge. It's really annoying, as maximizing applications will prevent me from seeing their borders. It also looks really ugly, as despite the monitor displaying the correct resolution internally, it's actually displaying a weird, large fraction of the 1440p that it's supposed to (since the borders are cut off) and it looks downscaled.\n This issue did not occur with my previous computer, and my primary monitor is working perfectly fine. Both monitors are 2560x1440. This issue persisted all the way from initial install from the bootable medium, through installation of KDE.\n Possible causes I've thought of:\n  \nI'm using an HDMI cable instead of a DisplayPort cable (I don't have the spare cable to test this, though)\n The monitor is too old for it to report its size to my GPU properly, so it's receiving an incorrect size.\n  \nDoes anyone have any help or suggestions for troubleshooting?\n    submitted by    /u/Psychological-Owl908  \n [link]   [comments]",

Il TGP dovrebbe attestarsi sui 450W.Con la versione 'Ti', il chip grafico potrebbe essere quindi ancora più potente e spingersi fino a un massimo di 18.432 shader.",

L'azienda, con sede centrale a Taiwan, è all'avanguardia per ciò che riguarda la presentazione di prodotti capaci di offrire frequenze di refresh elevate.La novità più recente consiste nella presentazione di una coppia di pannelli con risoluzione FullHD, refresh a 480 Hz e tempo di risposta inferiore al millisecondo.Si tratta di prodotti che andranno a sostituire gli attuali pannelli a 360 Hz presenti in molti portatili e monitor di fascia alta destinati ai videogiocatori che possono disporre di budget importanti.L'unico aspetto negativo per ciò che riguarda la nuova proposta di AU Optronics, è che si tratta di pannelli in tecnologia TN: da più parti si solleva quindi qualche dubbio sulla fedeltà cromatica.In un altro articolo abbiamo visto come scegliere il monitor del PC e descritto le differenze tra pannelli TN, IPS e VA.In ogni caso, AU Optronics fa segnare un record perché quelli presentati sono i primi dispositivi FullHD al mondo a raggiungere una frequenza di refresh di 480 Hz.Sebbene i portavoce di AU Optronics non si siano sbilanciati sulla data di disponibilità, diverse fonti confermano che i pannelli per i display a 480 Hz potrebbero cominciare a essere prodotti già durante quest'anno.Il video pubblicato a questo indirizzo mostra molti altri pannelli AU Optronics: tra di essi vi sono un IPS UHD a 165 Hz, diversi modelli per i sistemi di infotainment delle auto e gli AmLED, un tipo di mini LED..",

          "description": "Se si ha la necessità di accedere a un PC Windows o a un sistema macOS pur non conoscendo la password per il login, Kon Boot è una delle soluzioni che si sono storicamente rivelate più affidabili.Kon Boot nasce nel 2008 e con il tempo ha subìto molteplici aggiornamenti adattandosi alla continua evoluzione della tecnologia.La differenza rispetto ad altre soluzioni per superare il login di Windows e bypassare l'inserimento della password, anche sulle macchine basate su macOS, è che Kon Boot inietta il suo codice in memoria prima del caricamento del sistema operativo.Questa tattica permette a Kon Boot di modificare temporaneamente il comportamento del sistema di autenticazione utilizzato da Windows e macOS permettendo il semplice superamento della password.Kon Boot non modifica la configurazione di Windows e di macOS né cambia le password degli account già presenti: il suo comportamento è assimilabile a quello di un bootkit benigno.A meno che l'utente non confermi a Kon Boot la volontà di creare un nuovo account amministratore, dopo il caricamento del programma è sufficiente accedere con qualunque utente digitando una password casuale e premendo Invio.Kon Boot va installato in una chiavetta USB (lo sviluppatore consiglia l'utilizzo di un'unità da almeno 16 GB di capienza) e il supporto viene automaticamente reso avviabile: lasciando inserita la chiavetta ed effettuando il boot da tale supporto, il programma disporrà il caricamento del codice per la 'neutralizzazione' della procedura di autenticazione del sistema operativo.Per ripristinare la situazione precedente, a login effettuato basta semplicemente rimuovere la chiavetta con Kon Boot quindi spegnere la macchina oppure riavviarla.Kon Boot è assolutamente sicuro ma alcuni antimalware tendono a segnalarlo come una minaccia: ciò non deriva dal fatto che il programma contiene codice malevolo ma è semplicemente legato alla natura dell'utilità.",

Uno dei pochi svantaggi è che non vengono direttamente registrati tra i programmi utilizzabili per aprire un determinato tipo di file. In genere, il programma portable può avere le sue opzioni per poterlo fare, oppure possiamo noi cambiare manualmente questo tipo di associazione, ma grazie a Portable Registrator possiamo rendere più semplice questa associazione e registrare le applicazioni portable tra quelle utilizzabili.\n›› Leggi tutto",
