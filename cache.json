I used an nvidia gpu prior.\n I initially tried re-installing windows, but the windows installation media does not work either. I had been meaning to install arch back on my pc, so I figured this was a good time. However the arch installation media does not work either.\n I am aware of the grub kernel parameters and kernal mode settings, but I do not have much experience with them. It seems people have had this problem before and the solution is to add \"nomodeset\" as a kernel parameter. This however does nothing for me. The screen continues to go black after adding new valid and invalid parameters.\n I have also tried running the installation media with a BIOS boot, but my keyboards do not work in the arch menu for bios boot.

          "description": "I've tried so many different things without success that I resort to asking here. I'm trying to get python3.10 on my raspberry pi which runs an ARM1176 processor with the armv6l architecture.\n My first and most obvious attempt was to run a QEMU machine with the same OS and architecture, that way I could just compile there. I couldn't get a VM with the same architecture, the closest I got to it was running something similar to\n qemu-system-arm -machine raspi1ap -cpu arm1176 -kernel \"./vmlinuz\" -initrd \"./initrd.gz\" -cdrom file=debian-11.4.0-armhf-netinst.iso \n This would just give me a black screen and max a processor, even though I got the kernel and initrd from the right place for the iso (I got it working this way for another architecture). Prior to this I did get one ARM machine to boot and compile okay, but I didn't have the right machine and cpu parameters so the executables wouldn't run on the pi.\n Then, I went on to the second most obvious option which is to use the AUR packages for ARM cross-compilation. I managed to install them, but the executables wouldn't run because I had the wrong version of libc with them. I tried matching the gcc version from the pi, which is 10.2.1, the git from the AUR gave me 10.2.0 but that version required libc>=2.33 when the pi has libc version 2.31.\n One final attempt was to run a QEMU machine of the same Debian version but x86_64, and within it to cross-compile. That also failed because they don't include the machine armv6 anymore in their cross-compilers, so you would need to get the cross-compiler from some other shady source.\n    submitted by    /u/7dare  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am trying to set up duplicati (backup software) so that it can access my home directory to back it up. This seemed like a good fit for ACLs, so my first thought was to use those. ACLs should be enabled on my ext4 filesystem, and as expected tune2fs -l shows \"acl\", and /proc/mounts does not show \"noacl\".\n Duplicati runs as the user \"duplicati\" in the group \"duplicati\" (I've confirmed this with systemctl status duplicati.service). So, I tried to give access with: setfacl -R -m 'g:duplicati:rw' $HOME. However, duplicati still complained about permissions errors. I tried sudo -g duplicati ls $HOME, and it correctly listed my home directory. So then I tried to set it up to work with the user \"duplicati\", not the group, with setfacl -R -m 'u:duplicati:rw' $HOME. After that, running sudo -u duplicati ls $HOME shows a permissions error.\n getfacl $HOME gives:\n # file: home/vikingofrock # owner: vikingofrock # group: vikingofrock user::rwx user:duplicati:rw- group::--- group:duplicati:rw- mask::rw- other::--- \n So, my questions are:\n  \nWhy can the duplicati group access my home directory (as checked via sudo), but not the duplicati user?\n Why can't duplicati (the software) seem to access my home directory, despite being in the duplicati group (which apparently has access)?\n Is there a different set-up I should be using to get this to work? I'd rather not just give global permissions to let everything access my home directory if I can avoid it.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/VikingofRock  \n [link]   [comments]",

I use the swerty layout and ever since alt-gr isn't recognized correctly on that keyboard. For anyone unaware, left alt and right alt (alt-gr) are two completely different keys on a Swedish (or otherwise european) layout, meaning that when alt-gr isn't working I'm unable to write a lot of special characters such as :; [] etc. So a bit of an issue.\n Switching to a regular ISO keyboard with a standard ISO layout works fine and alt-gr is detected as it should. The issue is consistent across all DEs or WMs. The method of install is adding stuff to /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/se as well as /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.xml and those files are still intact and look as they should. \n The keymap works just like it should other than that, the only issue is that alt-gr isn't detected correctly.\n Using alt-gr on xev on swerty returns\n KeyPress event, serial 38, synthetic NO, window 0x3a00001, root 0x1e7, subw 0x0, time 19950654, (-1170,600), root:(610,637), state 0x0, keycode 108 (keysym 0xffea, Alt_R), same_screen YES, XLookupString gives 0 bytes: XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes: XFilterEvent returns: False \n While using it on regular ISO (which is the correct interpretation) is\n KeyPress event, serial 38, synthetic NO, window 0x3a00001, root 0x1e7, subw 0x0, time 20382268, (-1191,663), root:(588,699), state 0x2000, keycode 108 (keysym 0xfe03, ISO_Level3_Shift), same_screen YES, XKeysymToKeycode returns keycode: 92 XLookupString gives 0 bytes: XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes: XFilterEvent returns: False \n So clearly my swerty layout should return ISO_Level3_Shift rather than Alt_R\n I'm not sure where I should begin troubleshooting this, anyone got a pointer?

Amazon ha annunciato oggi che Drive chiuderà i battenti alla fine del 2023.Presentato come servizio di archiviazione cloud sicuro per i clienti Amazon al fine di effettuare il backup dei propri file, Drive offre 5 GB di spazio gratis per tutti gli utenti e la possibilità di accedere da Web oltre che tramite app Android e iOS.L'abbandono di Amazon Drive si concretizzerà attraverso una serie di tappe successive: il 31 ottobre 2022 Amazon rimuoverà le app Drive dagli store di Google ed Apple mentre dal 31 gennaio 2023 non saranno più accettati nuovi caricamenti di file sul cloud. Dal 31 dicembre 2023 gli utenti di Amazon Drive non potranno più visualizzare o scaricare i contenuti conservati sui server dell'azienda guidata da Jeff Bezos.Amazon suggerisce a tutti coloro che si servono del servizio Drive di scaricare i dati in locale prima di questa data limite.Nel caso in cui gli utenti dovessero incontrare difficoltà nel download di file pesanti oppure di un gran numero di elementi memorizzati su Amazon Drive, i tecnici della società suggeriscono di ricorrere al client desktop di Amazon Photos: esso consente di scaricare più di 5 GB o 1.000 file per volta.L'abbandono di Amazon Drive non avrà alcun effetto su Amazon Photos, il servizio che consente di archiviare sul cloud foto e video.Per gli abbonati Amazon Prime è assicurato il caricamento di un numero illimitato di foto, di qualunque peso e con qualsiasi risoluzione.Per approfondire, Amazon ha pubblicato una pagina contenente le risposte alle domande frequenti sulla chiusura di Drive e le istruzioni per recuperare per tempo i propri dati..",

Per ottenere lo sconto promozionale è necessario digitare il codice coupon TCNYTB al momento dell'invio dell'ordine.\n\nRealizzata in lega di alluminio, NIUBILITY B16 pesa circa 20 kg, dispone di ruote stabili da 16 pollici e misura 137 x 24 x 113 cm una volta aperta (78 x 35 x 65 cm quando ripiegata su se stessa).NIUBILITY B16 può essere utilizzata in due diverse modalità tra le quali c'è anche la pedalata assistita.Stando a quanto dichiarato dal produttore, la batteria da 10,4 Ah offre un'autonomia di circa 40-50 km con una singola ricarica (che richiede 4-6 ore).Il motore elettrico brushless da 350W è silenzioso e, grazie alla sua posizione, offre un ottimo bilanciamento della bici contribuendo ad assicurare una stabilità ancora maggiore.",

          "description": "Capita spesso di lavorare con documenti PDF che espongono un messaggio a tutta pagina con la dizione 'Bozza', 'Riservato', 'Confidenziale' e via dicendo. Questa soluzione grafica particolarmente invasiva che ha un effetto diretto sul layout del PDF si chiama filigrana o watermark: tutti i principali programmi per la gestione dei PDF consentono di aggiungerla, generalmente in obliquo a pagina intera. Interagire con i file PDF contenenti filigrane o watermark può essere fonte di distrazione ed è possibile quindi servirsi di un semplice metodo per eliminare l'elemento grafico superfluo.\nRimuovere filigrana o watermark dai documenti PDF\n Diamo per scontato che il file PDF sul quale si desidera intervenire per rimuovere filigrana o watermark sia sbloccato quindi liberamente gestibile.Il passaggio più ovvio per rimuovere il watermark consiste nell'utilizzare Adobe Acrobat Pro DC: dopo aver aperto il documento PDF che si desidera modificare basta fare clic sul pulsante Modifica PDF quindi su Filigrana, Rimuovi.La soluzione di Adobe, tuttavia, è a pagamento ed è possibile risolvere con i migliori strumenti per modificare PDF, molti dei quali sono gratuiti.\nRimozione del watermark con Microsoft Office\n Per chi utilizza Microsoft Office nelle versioni più recenti, una buona soluzione consiste nel cliccare sul menu File, Apri quindi selezionare il file PDF contenente il watermark.Alla comparsa del messaggio 'Word convertirà il documento PDF in un documento Word modificabile' è sufficiente premere OK.",

La società di Santa Clara si accinge a dismettere tutte le attività legate alla tecnologia Optane.Di Intel Optane e della tecnologia sviluppata di concerto con Micron che sta alla base del suo funzionamento (3D Xpoint) si parlava almeno dal 2015 ma solo nel 2017 cominciarono a fare capolino sul mercato i primi prodotti commerciali.Nell'articolo in cui spiegavamo cos'è Intel Optane abbiamo detto che si trattava di una tecnologia promettente, in grado potenzialmente di rivoluzionare il mercato dello storage.I moduli che Intel commercializzò permettevano di accelerare le prestazioni del sistema rimuovendo in larga parte il collo di bottiglia legato alle operazioni di lettura e, soprattutto, di scrittura effettuate sugli hard disk tradizionali.Con le soluzioni Optane DC Persistent Memory Intel ha poi cominciato, dal 2018, a guardare a prodotti evoluti capaci di combinare le funzionalità di RAM e SSD.Il fatto è che le soluzioni Optane non sono mai riuscite a fare breccia sul mercato.",

          "description": "I dati che si gestiscono in azienda, in ufficio o presso uno studio professionale hanno un valore immenso. Fermatevi soltanto un attimo a pensare cosa accadrebbe se improvvisamente perdeste i dati che ogni giorno utilizzate per svolgere le vostre attività. Come reagireste? Come potreste continuare a svolgere il vostro lavoro?Lo sanno bene quelle realtà aziendali che purtroppo sono state vittime di attacchi ransomware senza disporre di backup aggiornati dei dati.Un'infezione da ransomware che va a buon fine è una sconfitta per qualsiasi realtà aziendale, per gli amministratori IT e per le figure che si occupano di sicurezza. La cifratura dei dati da parte di un ransomware rappresenta infatti soltanto l'ultima fase di un attacco informatico nato molto prima e in grado di sfruttare evidenti lacune nella configurazione della rete, nella gestione dei permessi, nella condivisione delle risorse, nella protezione di server, workstation e singoli endpoint, nella mancata applicazione di aggiornamenti di sicurezza, nell'utilizzo di dispositivi insicuri, nella mancata adozione di strumenti centralizzati per la difesa dell'infrastruttura.Anche seguendo tutte le linee guida e utilizzando i migliori strumenti per la difesa del perimetro aziendale, è tuttavia impensabile avere la certezza di essere protetti al 100%.Per questo, come abbiamo spesso ricordato, è essenziale predisporre un efficace piano di disaster recovery.",
