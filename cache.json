But when my profile is sourced, I don't have the relevant environment variables set, and pgrep tells me ssh-agent isn't running. (It does seem to have started 10s later.)\n If I knew what was starting it, I might be able to hook into that to run ssh-add? But I can't figure out how ssh-agent is getting started, or how the SSH_AGENT_PID and SSH_AUTH_SOCK variables get put in my environment. Using ack I can't find any references to them that would be having this effect in $HOME, /etc or /usr/share. The words ssh and agent don't show up in systemctl list-units.\n According to pstree the parent of ssh-agent is systemd(1), so I guess whatever did start it disowned it? Maybe there's no way to find this out in general, I dunno.\n Feels potentially relevant that I'm running xfce and use sddm as a login manager and zsh as my shell.\n (Probably another option is to do something like, wait 10s then fork a new non-login shell and do ssh-add in that? Haven't specifically checked if that will work. It feels a bit dirty, but I'll do it if there's nothing else.)\n ETA: If I log in on vt2 I get a login shell without the environment variables set, and opening a subshell there I still don't have them.

          "description": "Greetings. \n I have been using Arch for a while now on lap;top, and I have stumbled upon a problem that I could not find a way to fix.\n Basically, once I plug in the wireless USB adapter for the mouse, it starts to arbitrarily trigger hibernation. I use the same mouse on a desktop that also runs Arch Linux but there was never such kind of problem. \n The best lead I could find was that the auto suspension features of the mouse on low battery would be caught by the system, thus causing hibernation. However, it still persists even when I put a brand new battery.\n I have tried the \"USB Mouse sleeping after 5 seconds when on battery\" from the Laptop Mode Tools scripts suite, but it does not seem to be related to this issue, all thing considered.\n Has anyone here encountered a similar problem ? Is there some solution that I might have looked over ? \n Thank you in advance for your time, and best regards.\n    submitted by    /u/dosssman  \n [link]   [comments]",

CPU was on 0-3% so I was like: \"Hmm, that's weird\". But when I moved my mouse around, the CPU jumped to 20%, sometimes to 30% for all cores... So I booted into live Void Linux ISO to see if it's a problem with Arch/bspwm and it wasn't, the same thing was happening on Void Linux, then I changed my mouse to a wired one and... The issue was gone... \n ​\n Anyone knows what is going on? Should I return my mouse? Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/DominiCzech  \n [link]   [comments]",

Le batterie dei dispositivi più compatti sono comunque piccole potendo garantire una manciata di Wh (wattora).Con un'unità di misura come il wattora si esprime infatti l'energia complessiva fornita dalla batteria (potenza elettrica di un Watt mantenuta per un'ora).Nel caso degli smartphone e dei tablet di solito ci si limita a parlare dei mAh o milliampereora: questo valore indica la capacità di carica della batteria.Le batterie degli smartphone vengono confrontate usando i mAh e non i wattora perché la tensione non cambia tra i modelli dei vari produttori ed è sempre attestata tra 3,6 e 3,8 V.\nCome calcolare quanto costa ricaricare la batteria\n Ci sono due modi per calcolare quanto costa ricaricare una batteria.",

          "description": "Con l'acronimo IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) si fa comunemente riferimento alla tecnologia che consente di trasferire flussi audio-video utilizzati nelle trasmissioni televisive sfruttando la rete Internet. Nella definizione di IPTV si cita il protocollo TCP/IP quando, all'atto pratico, lo streaming viene spesso poi gestito via UDP (User Datagram Protocol) in modo da velocizzare le trasmissioni e ottimizzare la resa del flusso multimediale anche in presenza di perdita di pacchetti (si pensi a reti congestionate o connessioni instabili come quella su rete mobile).Utilizzare un sistema IPTV è assolutamente legale, a patto di disporre dei diritti per accedere e visualizzare il contenuto. Ne parliamo nell'articolo in cui ci soffermiamo sul concetto di smart IPTV.Siti come iptv-org su GitHub offrono file M3U ovvero playlist per lettori multimediali.Si tratta di file che contengono riferimenti diretti ai server di streaming multimediale delle varie emittenti televisive: sono gli stessi network TV a pubblicare tali flussi e renderli disponibili agli utenti.Nelle pagine di iptv-org si trovano i canali IPTV suddivisi per categoria, lingua, nazione e regione.Ciascun file in formato M3U può essere aperto con un editor di testo in modo da verificarne il contenuto.\nCasting IPTV sulla chiavetta Google Chromecast\n Per i possessori di un dispositivo Android e per chi utilizza Google Chrome in Windows o macOS, l'utilizzo della chiavetta Chromecast è diventato essenziale.",

Osservando le date, le email si fermano ad alcune settimane prima.In passato Microsoft confermò che il malfunzionamento nella ricerca di Outlook interessava i sistemi Windows 10 sui quali era stato installato l'aggiornamento KB5008212 di dicembre 2021 e le macchine basate su Windows 11.A luglio 2022 Microsoft rivela che il problema è tornato a manifestarsi interessando, questa volta, soltanto gli utenti di Windows 11.In attesa che i tecnici Microsoft rilascino una patch correttiva o comunque pubblichino informazioni più dettagliate, per risolvere il problema si può disattivare temporaneamente la ricerca di Windows (Windows Search) lasciando che Outlook si affidi solo a quella interna.",

For AMD's packaged Linux driver stack it only supports those select enterprise Linux distributions and can run into pain points trying to run elsewhere or even say running brand new LTS distributions at times can lack support. There are also challenges in installing/running the ROCm compute stack outside of the few officially supported Linux distributions by AMD.
