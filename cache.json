          "description": "Hi everyone. I've recently hopped over to arch (gnome), and I've been having problems with my CPU temperatures. Before this, I was using Manjaro, and everything worked fine. Now, when idling the cpu sits at 50-60*C and when doing heavy tasks it gets up to 100*C. My fans are fine, this is a recently purchased Acer Swift 3, so what I'm guessing is the problem is that the OS isn't communicating with some hardware. I've ran sensors-detect, and tried controlling my fan speed that way, but it comes back with \"There are no pwm capable fans in your system', which may be the problem. (Side note: After installing arch and installing some packages, my maximum RAM went down from ~16.4 to 15.2, the same as I had on Manjaro, even though when I play some games with memory leaks the ram usage will rise above that number. Probably unrelated, but thought I should share.) Anyways, if you need more info let me know, all help appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/Key_Squirre1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "It almost seems like the Xorg session is related or something? This system just started doing this consistently yesterday but its done it in the past with an older install of arch but it was rare and reboot resolved it so I never figured out the why.\n basically the audio wont work at all for anything in anyway and video playback in web-browser, specifically youtube and twitch wont really play. I can scrub a youtube video and video play back window will update with an image of whats in the video at that point I stopped in the time line but it wont play said video. Twitch will update one frame every like 30 seconds but thats it. this issue is persistent in both firefox and google chrome. I can play an mkv or local video via VLC just fine (though still no audio). Audio is set to the right output, wont work if I send it to the onboard audio out or bluetooth.\n if i log out of my DE (KDE plasma xorg) and sign into (KDE) wayland, it all works fine, audio plays, video will render and play. I'd love to just ditch xorg and go to wayland but wayland seems to have its own issues, primarily games wont render a framerate higher than my displays refresh rate and I've not been able to find any info on solving that issue so I've been sticking to Xorg but this issue is worse so im at a bit of a loss on how to fix it.\n this happened yesterday, a reboot didnt solve the issue. I nuked the nvidia drivers, rebooted, reinstalled the nvidia drivers and that seemed to have fixed it so I thought that was that but the issue has returned today and im not quite sure where the junction is cuz I thought video rendering and audio issues were normally entirely separate so idk whats up.\n any one have any idea or point me in a useful direction?\n ​\n system:\n  \narch 5.17.5\n plasma 5.24.4\n Ryzen 5 3600x\n 16gb ddr4 ram\n nvidia 1080 w/ 510.60.02 drivers\n  \n   submitted by    /u/TONKAHANAH  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I was playing around with my system today trying to compile and fix some things, and one of these things required me to patch the Linux kernel. I used the ABS method, patched, and compiled with makepkg -s. The patch didn't fix my issue so it's irrelevant to the post, but it was the reason for building the kernel in the first place. \n Before I compiled it, for another thing I was messing around, I had also changed makepkg.conf to include march=native and to use all my CPU cores. For some reason, after booting my custom kernel (which should be the same as the one Arch Linux provides), it feels more responsive, but I have no easy way to verify it, other than going back to the arch kernel and running similar benchmarks\n My question is, is there performance or other benefits in building your own kernel ? and is there an easy way to compare the responsiveness of the kernels?\n    submitted by    /u/-Luciddream-  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi /r/archlinux. I discovered a simple but really great helper package today that I never saw mentioned anywhere, and thought I'd share: makepkg-meta.\n It allows you to easily create and update meta packages, i.e. packages whose sole job it is to pull in other dependencies. My use case is cleaner management of optional dependencies. \n With those, the question is always whether you install them --asdeps or --asexplicit. In the former case, they may get removed accidentally, in the latter case I often forget to remove them when uninstalling the depending package, so they just clutter the system (\"Hmm, do I still need that? Better leave it alone.\").\n Instead, create a meta package that depends on the package and all your chosen optional dependencies.\n E.g. to install zim with optional gnuplot and xdot, run\n makepkg-meta zim-meta -a zim -a gnuplot -a xdot \n which will create and install (*) a meta package zim-meta with the specified dependencies. All packages will be kept installed as long as it's there, and if you run pacman -Rsc zim, it gets removed automatically, taking the optional deps with it if needed.\n Adding more dependencies later can be done by a similar call (-a -> add). To remove a dependency, use\n makepkg-meta zim-meta -r xdot \n This will update the meta package, making xdot obsolete. Then, uninstall it via pacman -Rsc xdot or even\n pacman -Qdttq | sudo pacman -Rsc - \n to remove all orphan packages (since they're all really obsolete now that you know this trick).\n (*): AUR packages need to be installed (--asdeps) first, the tool uses pacman internally, so it can't resolve them. Or patch the script to use your AUR helper of choice.\n    submitted by    /u/axaxaxasmloe  \n [link]   [comments]",

Lo studio in questione dal titolo Your Echos are Heard è consultabile a questo indirizzo.Sia la società di Jeff Bezos che ben 41 partner pubblicitari utilizzerebbero i dati raccolti dai dispositivi Amazon Echo per creare profili degli utenti e servire annunci 'ad hoc'.
