          "description": "I recently installed Arch, but I noticed that I was unable to see any wireless access points with iwctl. Someone suggested that I may need linux-firmware, so I used my installation medium and arch-chroot to grab it. I also did a pacman -Syu. Now, when I try to boot into the OS after decrypting my partition, I see [FAILED] Failed to start Load Kernel Modules. and several instances of [FAILED] Failed to start Wireless services. before proceeding to the login screen. I can still login, but when I tried to launch iwctl, I got stuck on \"waiting for IWD to respond,\" so clearly I broke something.\n I did some googling, and it seems that this can be caused by an unmounted /boot, but if I am understanding the output of lsblk -f correctly, then mine is mounted. I could also see /boot in my fstab (I should maybe mention, however, that it is on a different partition).\n My googling also revealed that not having mounted boot while in chroot and then updating the system may have caused the issue. I tried reinstalling linux after making sure to mount boot while in chroot but that didn't help. I also tried running mkinitcpio -p linux in arch-chroot, but that didn't help either unfortunately.\n Any idea what I can try next?\n    submitted by    /u/networks_dumbass  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone. I just installed Arch on a x86_64 CPU board, which has a LVDS display flat connector output (that i don't use).\n I connected it to my monitor using HDMI connector output, and it works fine, except for the boot sequence.\n When the system boots, i can see grub loader screen on hdmi (because it uses uefi frame buffers i guess) and then, when it switches to KMS (Intel graphics driver requires this) i cannot se any plymouth screen, and after boot, it shows a completely gray screen. It keeps showing that forever, and i have to press 'enter' key (blindly) to login and see the desktop environment. I use GNOME, and in the settings, it's like the flat LVDS connector is plugged in (i see a second monitor connected). Once logged in, X loads the right screen configuration and everything works like it should. I believe that everything works just fine, except for the fact that it shows the login (and plymouth graphics) on thr LVDS panel. I have no LVDS to prove this, but i am 85% sure about that.\n I installed intel graphics driver, mesa and lib32-mesa libraries. I early-loaded i915 driver putting MODULES=(i915) in the /etc/mkinitcpio.conf file and rebuilding initramfs images. I tried to switch off LVDS in bios but the bios is very minimal and i don't see any setting for that.\n It seems to be a KMS setting or graphic driver setting.\n Is anyone here more experienced with intel drivers? Where may i find drivers parameters that i can use to disconnect that unused display?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/nemis16  \n [link]   [comments]",
