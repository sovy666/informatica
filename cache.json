          "description": "I need to run a script when the battery charge reaches >90%. All solutions I have found on the internet are based on a bash/python script that checks for current charge level, and it includes an infinite loop with sleep 1, or uses crontab. This seems very forceful to me, and an unnecessary use of resources. Is there nowhere in linux to catch the event of a battery charge change, and only fire the script when it does? I am using KDE if it matters.\n Why do I even need this? I would like to stop the battery charging when it reaches 90%. My Lenovo Legion 5 laptop has this option in the firmware, but it only stops at 60%, and there is no way to change this limit (which can be done on ThinkPads). My goal is to enable this option when it reaches 90%. (Which is greater than 60% and the firmware will stop charging)\n    submitted by    /u/Motylde  \n [link]   [comments]",

The appeal to me is probably the same appeal to everyone else: complete customizeability, community-driven, fun to tinker with, etc.\n But I'm very much new to the Linux world and don't really know what sort of things Arch does that other don't, nor what I'm giving up by going Arch over other distributions.\n For example, I play League of Legends. The traditional way of getting League on Linux is through Play On Linux with a special Wine version. Is that something that's doable on Arch?\n Are all Proton Steam games available on Arch in a streamlined/easy way? Meaning, I just install steam, select the \"proton experimental\" button and suddenly I can download Apex Legends? Or are there more steps?\n Are there any difficulties with peripherals? Is my mouse/headset/Blue Yeti going to work easily?\n In short, am I giving up any software accessibility by going Arch or is everything that's available on other Linux distributions mostly available on Arch?\n And how difficult is the installation process *truly*? I get that it's supposedly difficult, but is it so difficult that even following a guide wouldn't be sufficient to get it installed correctly the first time?\n Thanks!\n ​\n Strong edit for some things I want to do on Linux:\n  \nPlay League of Legends/Battle.net games/Steam Proton games.\n Install i3 Window Tiling Manager\n Custom keybinds\n Install Unreal Engine\n Vim\n  \n​\n    submitted by    /u/mushroomgambit  \n [link]   [comments]",

Only firefox and vim as additional packages.\n Install went smooth, no errors. I rebooted and instead of finding myself on a bare minimum login screen I was on a command line asking for my user and password.\n I though that the minimum install would give me a desktop environment so I just though that I should reboot and reinstall with kde as an aditional package and I would be golden.\n That's when things went wrong.\n Firstly the bios refused to show up, the pc was dead. I tried reseting a few times while waiting a few minutes and nothing.\n Then out of nowhere, while doing some research of my phone on what I might have done wrong the bios showed up. The install must have done something weird to my sistem so I tried booting on the flashdrive again so I could reinstall Arch and try checking what I've done wrong.\n But it is soooo, sloooow, like, it takes minutes to leave the boot screen. Right now I've been waiting for the flashdrive to boot, it's so slow that I can't tell if it's worlking or stuck. When I press delete it instantle goes to the bios config screen so it is still respondive.\n Edit: I was able to get to the install again by restoring default bios config and booting the flash drive. Do you guys have any idea of what's going on? I might have made a mistake while configuring the disk layout, I'm having a hard time making heads or tailsof whats going on in the install, so my plan is to let it do what it want on the drive I want the system to be, and set the rest on a graphical interface later.\n    submitted by    /u/GreenRiot  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I started my linux journey with Ubuntu back in '08. It was wonderfully freeing. Later on down the road I started trying new distros. I didn't really give Arch a chance until around 2012 and it was quite a bit different back then. But one thing I loved was the documentation and how much it taught me about linux and maintaining the system itself. Using Ubuntu was freeing but it also felt like I didn't really get what was going on under the surface because I didn't really have a hand to play in any of it.\n So that's a really long-winded way to start this post but my main question for you all is - what could Gentoo teach me? Is there any advantage? I don't know if I would stick with it for long and it's not like I want to switch away from Arch but I'm thinking that maybe it would be able to help teach me a few things if I tried it for a while. Am I completely off-base here? Or does anybody that has tried both have any input on this? I appreciate any replies.\n    submitted by    /u/dasonk  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Uno dei programmi storicamente più apprezzati dagli utenti di Windows era certamente CCleaner. Usiamo l'imperfetto perché, nonostante l'applicazione vantasse ottime recensioni fin dalla data di debutto della prima versione, nel lontano 2003, tra il 2018 e il 2019 qualcosa si è rotto nel rapporto con gli utenti.A metà del 2017 Avast acquisì Piriform ovvero la software house sviluppatrice di CCleaner e di altre note utilità. L'anno seguente un gruppo di criminali informatici riuscì a sostituire la versione originale dell'applicazione con una dannosa agendo sui server dell'azienda e nel 2020 destò scalpore la raccolta di dati effettuata senza il consenso degli utenti.Da allora Piriform assunse un impegno preciso e spiegò che avrebbe risolto ogni problematica in sospeso cercando di riguadagnare la fiducia degli utenti.Dopo i precedenti 'scivoloni', CCleaner è tornato un software decisamente più affidabile anche se la mancata condivisione del codice sorgente (non è un progetto open source) resta un problema per molti utenti.CCleaner 6.0 è l'ultima versione del software che Piriform ha appena iniziato a distribuire attraverso i suoi server: l'abbiamo provata e al momento non viene proposta l'installazione di alcun software aggiuntivo o potenzialmente inutile come accaduto in passato e come segnalava lo stesso Microsoft Defender.",
