When I'm using any other software, it doesn't activate the key inside the VDI.\n So my question is: Can I change that behavior to isolate the super key when I'm using my VDI? \n For example, if I'm typing inside the VDI and I hit the super key, it just opens the startup menu from the VDI and not both the VDI and the desktop.\n    submitted by    /u/fabioreisritter  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was more used to creating them through interface programs. The fact is, I always used to have some kind of problem when creating them by console.\n Months ago I discovered the Arch wiki, it's been such a blessing to me. I'm learning a lot of topics and thanks to it I find myself improving on Linux.\n But here comes what happened. The other day I was looking how to create a bootable disk on the wiki. After reading on a lot of websites, I got to this line.\n \"Make sure that it is not mounted.\"\n That simple sentence made my mind explode. All these years having issues trying to create a bootable through the console. I've formatted a drive multiple times just to make sure I understood. So I unmount the file system, and then I use some of the commands.\n Conclusion: My problems creating a bootable disk are gone.\n But I'm a curious person, and I always like to understand everything, so... Here I go!\n Questions\n  \nWhy do we need to unmount the file system in order to write the iso to the drive?\n \nWhy does the process usually fail when the file system is mounted?\n \nWhat is happening exactly when I do something like \"cat arch.iso > /dev/sdx\"?\n \nAnd maybe this is a weird question, but why exactly does that work and not \"cat arch.iso > /dev/sdx1\" is it because the .iso file itself is like doing disk1(iso) > disk2(drive)?\n \n I'm still pretty newbie related some Linux things.\n I appreciate your patience just for the fact of reading all this. I look forward to see if I can understand whatever you explain! Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Nuxmin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Many arch users install both a kernel package of their choice and an additional kernel as a sort of \"backup\". This does not provide as much robustness as it could, largely due to what seems like an easily fixable design issue with pacman/dkms/mkinitcpio.\n For example, I have both the linux and linux-lts packages installed, and by default mkinitcpio creates both an autodetect and a fallback initramfs for both kernels, resulting in a total of 4 different images. One would expect that having 4 different initramfs to choose from would provide some robustness against boot issues.\n But it turns out that if you do a full pacman system update, it can apparently remove all the old vmlinuz and initramfs images from /boot/ before generating new ones. This seems to be related to dkms, as the /boot/ images are no longer present after the '70-dkms-install.hook' is invoked, but are only recreated by mkinitcpio after dkms is done (which depending on the number of dkms modules * number of kernels may take a while, e.g. a minute or so). So if your computer crashes during that vulnerable interval between the deletion of all the old /boot/ images at the same time and the generation of the new ones, you will end up with nothing to boot from.\n This issue seems entirely preventable by simply making sure that the /boot/ files are replaced sequentially, i.e. if pacman is called to update two or more kernels at the same time, do not let anything erase the /boot/ files related to two or more kernels simultaneously, but do it one after the other; do not touch any /boot/ files related to the second kernel while the first kernel is getting updated, and only begin updating the images related to the second kernel after the initramfs and vmlinuz images have already been generated for the first.\n    submitted by    /u/rotflol  \n [link]   [comments]",

The main thing that I couldn't quite figure out just yet, is how to lock my laptop (slock) whenever it suspends and/or the lid is closed, since that doesn't seem to be handled by the window manager, but rather systemd. If there are any articles on this or you have encountered this before, I'd be super thankful if you could give me a hand! Thanks in advance :)\n    submitted by    /u/OakArtz  \n [link]   [comments]",

Mozilla non ha però mai rilasciato un client email per i dispositivi mobili.La notizia è che Thunderbird per Android sarà costruito partendo dalle solide fondamenta della nota app K-9 Mail.È dal 2018, infatti, che Ryan Lee Sipes, Product Manager di Thunderbird, e Christian Ketterer, responsabile dello sviluppo di K-9 Mail si confrontavano sulla possibilità di 'unire le forze' e realizzare un client di posta per i dispositivi Android senza ripartire da zero.Così oggi arriva la conferma: K-9 Mail si trasformerà in Thunderbird per Android. L'attuale applicazione K-9 Mail cambierà nome e utilizzerà il nome e il marchio Thunderbird.'Prima che ciò accada dobbiamo raggiungere alcuni traguardi di sviluppo che porteranno K-9 Mail ad allinearsi con l'insieme di funzionalità e l'aspetto visivo di Thunderbird' per i sistemi desktop, si legge in una nota ufficiale.Tante funzionalità saranno quindi a breve aggiunte in K-9 Mail: la configurazione dell'account utilizzando il rilevamento e l'impostazione automatica di Thunderbird; la gestione delle cartelle migliorata; il supporto per i filtri dei messaggi; la sincronizzazione tra client desktop e mobile Thunderbird.Già oggi K-9 Mail supporta una casella di posta unificata, la gestione di identità multiple, il supporto per i messaggi crittografati con GPG e PGP/MIME, l'assegnazione di etichette e 'marcatori' alle varie email, le notifiche per singolo account e molto altro ancora.A questo punto è lecito aspettarsi che K-9 Mail supporti a sua volta, come fa Thunderbird desktop, anche l'autenticazione via OAuth.",

          "description": "Earlier this month marked the launch of the HP Dev One as an interesting collaboration between HP and System76 for a laptop optimized for Linux developers and running System76's Ubuntu-based Pop!_OS operating system. It's a very interesting laptop and well thought out for Linux use with an AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 5850U SoC and integrated Radeon graphics for satisfying the preferences of many Linux developers preferring a fully open-source driver stack. Thanks to the large scale manufacturing of HP, it's also a competitively-priced Linux laptop compared to many of the Linux laptops from smaller vendors that are based on Clevo or other white box laptop designs.",
