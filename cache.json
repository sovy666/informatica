CPU was on 0-3% so I was like: \"Hmm, that's weird\". But when I moved my mouse around, the CPU jumped to 20%, sometimes to 30% for all cores... So I booted into live Void Linux ISO to see if it's a problem with Arch/bspwm and it wasn't, the same thing was happening on Void Linux, then I changed my mouse to a wired one and... The issue was gone... \n ​\n Anyone knows what is going on? Should I return my mouse? Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/DominiCzech  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'll try to explain exactly how it happens.\n I plug in my USB flash drive, turn on the computer and mash F11 until I get boot menu. I sellect the USB.\n After that the menu pops up, I select Arch Linux install medium x64 UEFI.\n That goes away and in a split second I see these 4 lines:\n ::running early hook [udev] Starting version 251.2-1-arch ::running early hook [archiso_pxe_...] ::running hook [udev] \n That's basically it, after that screen goes black and I can only restart my PC.\n ​\n My USB drive is flashed with the latest ISO via Etcher. First I thought that the flash went wrong, but when I plug the drive into some old laptop that I have, it boots right into installation.\n When it comes to BIOS settings, secure boot is disabled, only thing that's on is fast boot but I'm not sure if that would change anything.\n My specs are:\n 11600k\n z590 Pro WIFI from MSI\n 3080 FE\n ​\n If anyone has an idea what to do I would be very grateful, I've installed Arch on other systems several times without problems... \n EDIT: I tried changing fast boot to disabled, did nothing. I also tried flashing ISO with Rufus both as ISO or DD image, also did nothing.\n    submitted by    /u/dabrrrr  \n [link]   [comments]",
