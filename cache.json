[0x0513ba40] DEBUG - Networking: Create request 2: (POST https://plex.tv/api/v2/pins?strong=true). [0xf61fb640] DEBUG - Networking: Completed request 2: (POST https://plex.tv/api/v2/pins?strong=true) with code -59 (have 0 bytes) in 146 ms. [Javascript] ERROR - Auth: Could not get PIN HTTP status -59 \n cURL's manual states code 59 means it cannot use the selected SSL cipher (whatever that may be). \n The Plexamp Appimage doesn't seem to be at fault as it hadn't been updated before it broke and it works without issue on an xUbuntu 21.10 machine I have. Additionally, although I'm running Arch, I grabbed the latest Manjaro daily build as well as a build from April and threw them into a VM for testing. Plexamp had no issues with the build from April but the daily build exhibited the same behavior as Arch, cURL code -59.\n Worth noting the Flatpak version of Plexamp works as expected, but Plexamp by default doesn't have a titlebar and I only had success force enabling it with the Appimage version.\n Tried downgrading OpenSSL and cURL but had no luck. I'm not sure where to go from here, especially since I thought Appimages contained all the required dependencies and wouldn't rely on system packages. Any suggestions would be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/CarelessSpark  \n [link]   [comments]",

Even though pacman keeps track of this information, it doesn't show it by default.\n This can happen because of \n  \nusing pacman -R instead of pacman -Rs to remove packages (dependencies stay installed)\n makedeps stay installed after building AUR packages\n packages removing dependencies in newer versions (without you noticing)\n  \nYou can remove them by doing pacman -Qtdq | pacman -Rns - but check the list carefully first since some of those packages you might actually want to keep, especially if your installation is very old.\n I've added all this info to the Pacman tips: Removing unused packages section of the Wiki. \n I've also created pacman-log-orphans-hook[AUR] which logs the list of unused packages whenever pacman runs.\n    submitted by    /u/tehdog  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Sebbene l'espediente sia in sé piuttosto semplice, è difficile che gli utenti più esperti cadano nella trappola. Purtuttavia riteniamo importante parlare di un trucco svelato da Rahul Sasi, fondatore e CEO di CloudSEK, che viene già utilizzato per rubare account WhatsApp sottraendo anche il contenuto delle chat, degli allegati e la lista dei contatti altrui.Sasi ha spiegato che utilizzando un po’ di ingegneria sociale, un aggressore può invitare la vittima a chiamare un numero di telefono che inizia con * o #. Ricordiamo che con questi due simboli si possono invocare i codici MMI (Man Machine Interface): si tratta di 'scorciatoie' che, sotto forma di numeri brevi, possono essere inviate all'operatore di telecomunicazioni mobile per attivare o disattivare servizi oppure per consultarne lo stato.Ogni operatore utilizza dei codici MMI che permettono di attivare la deviazione delle chiamate quando l'utenza in uso fosse irraggiungibile oppure risultasse occupata in altra conversazione.Se l'utente, magari poco pratico con l'uso dei codici MMI, effettuasse una chiamata usando il numero fornito dal malintenzionato, questi potrebbe di fatto attivare un inoltro di tutte le chiamate in arrivo verso una numerazione che non è più sotto il suo controllo.L'utente interessato a mettere le mani sui dati WhatsApp altrui può usare codici come **67* o *405* seguiti da un numero telefonico da lui gestito per indurre la vittima a richiedere la deviazione delle chiamate verso tale numerazione.A questo punto il criminale dovrebbe semplicemente richiedere l'attivazione di WhatsApp sul nuovo numero e attivare l'autenticazione a due fattori in modo che il legittimo proprietario dell'account non possa più accedervi.",

Esattamente un anno fa Qualcomm si dichiarò pronta a formare una cordata per rilevare ARM se NVidia non fosse riuscita a chiudere l'operazione.Adesso che NVidia ha dovuto accantonare il progetto di acquisizione di ARM, soprattutto in forza delle crescenti pressioni esercitate dalle Autorità competenti in materia di antitrust, arriva la notizia che Qualcomm potrebbe effettivamente attivarsi per creare una piattaforma comune tra i big dell'industria volta all'acquisizione di ARM.D'altra parte nubi nere sull'accordo NVidia-ARM (del valore di 40 miliardi di dollari) si erano addensate già a dicembre 2021 quando la FTC parlò dell'eventuale intesa come di una minaccia concreta sul piano della concorrenza: NVidia si sarebbe di fatto trovata in una situazione di monopolio totale tenendo per sé le redini della parte più ampia del mercato dei chip per i dispositivi mobili e mettendo una seria ipoteca sullo sviluppo delle soluzioni per il mercato professionale, server e data center.A suo tempo parlammo delle possibili conseguenze di un accordo NVidia-ARM.Riferendosi ad ARM, il CEO di Qualcomm Cristiano Amon ha descritto la società britannica come 'una risorsa molto importante che sarà essenziale per lo sviluppo del settore'.",

          "description": "Chi utilizza da tempo un PC sa riconoscere benissimo quando la macchina utilizza almeno un hard disk. I dischi fissi tradizionali utilizzano infatti più piatti in rapida rotazione: su ciascuno di essi 'volano' a una distanza di pochi nanometri le testine che si occupano della lettura e della scrittura dei dati.Quando un hard disk che era rimasto inutilizzato si avvia per cominciare un'attività di lettura o scrittura, esso entra nella fase di spin-up: i piatti vengono accelerati per essere messi in rotazione fino a raggiungere la velocità di rotazione operativa. È immediato riconoscere il rumore di un hard disk che sta effettuando lo spin-up.Nell'articolo su come riparare gli hard disk abbiamo presentato anche i rumori che vengono generalmente prodotti dalle unità che hanno qualche problema hardware.Le unità SSD essendo basate esclusivamente su memorie flash non hanno parti in movimento e non fanno rumore: in un altro articolo abbiamo visto le principali differenze tra hard disk e SSD.Nel caso di un PC desktop aprendo il case è piuttosto semplice riconoscere quali sono hard disk e quali unità SSD.Gli SSD meno performanti utilizzando la stessa interfaccia SATA (nel caso di SATA III in grado di trasferire fino a 6 Gbps) degli hard disk; le unità SSD più moderne e performanti utilizzando il bus PCI Express ormai giunto alla versione 5.0 (PCIe 5.0) in una continua escalation in termini di banda e prestazioni.Come visto nell'articolo dedicato agli SSD PCIe NVMe quelli basati su interfaccia PCIe 3.0 possono trasferire dati fino a 3.500 MB/s e 3.300 MB/s in lettura e scrittura; fino a 7.000 MB/s e 5.000 MB/s rispettivamente in lettura e scrittura con PCIe 4.0 usando schede madri con chipset e processori compatibili.",
