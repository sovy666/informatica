          "description": "Yesterday I ran a Windows 10 update which required a restart. My setup is Windows 10 and Archlinux dual-booted on the same SSD. Windows was installed first, so I use its esp for systemdboot, and a separate partition for XBOOTLDR. After the Windows update, my Arch loader entries no longer appear in the boot menu. Windows itself, and all my NTFS partitions, work fine.\n I checked the various common culprits, and confirmed that secure boot, fast boot, fast start, and Windows hibernation were all still disabled. My next step was to boot up the Arch live ISO to attempt repair, but I've found that I can no longer mount sda5 and sda6 to /mnt/boot and /mnt, or at all for that matter. I get an error along the lines of bad fs, bad options, or bad superblock.\n I am confused because those are my two Linux partitions (formatted to fat32 and ext4, respectively,) and neither are mounted in Windows. How could the WIndows update have messed them up? My theory is that the update resized some Windows partitions, which messed up some blocks, but I'm not a filesystem expert.\n Can fsck repair this issue, and is there a way of preventing WIndows from doing this again in the future?\n    submitted by    /u/StarTroop  \n [link]   [comments]",

Yet, now in the next day, I can enter the grub, yes, but after selecting to boot Arch (be it the Linux Kernel or the Linux-Zen one) and it seems to load normally but then it simply remains pitch black. And no, it's not just the graphical user interface, I can't bring the terminal up either.\n So, I tried using my installation media on a stick to repair, but weirdly it doesn't seem to boot either. I can select it from the boot menu on the bios, and it does boot into the \"options\" (install UEFI, install UEFI with voice, RAM etc.) but it doesn't matter what I select, it too seems to fail to boot.\n I am no \"arch newbie\", been using it for a year or so now, but I am really lost here, I suspect (but I hope it's not) something hardware-related at this point\n EDIT: Update, was able to enter the installation media by booting it on legacy mode and using the load into RAM option\n EDIT2: Ok, was able to chroot by doing so, updated the system once again via sudo pacman -Syu something with a package called libvterm broke but now it's fixed.

Here is my configuration:\n Model: 13-be0006ur\n CPU: Ryzen 5 5600U (15W)\n RAM: 16GB\n SSD: 512GB\n Display: 13\" IPS 2560x1600\n WiFi: Realtek 8852AE\n When installing Arch Linux, it is not possible to connect to Wi-Fi because there is no driver for Realtek 8852AE. There is no Ethernet port and the iPhone is used as a modem via USB. But Arch Linux doesn't see the iPhone, as far as I know, because when connecting via USB the iPhone needs to use iTunes as a modem. Can you tell me how to install the driver then and install Arch Linux? Do I need to look for an Android phone? I'm confused and can't solve this problem. I would appreciate your help!\n    submitted by    /u/scamlord666  \n [link]   [comments]",
