Anzi. Trovare le password salvate con il browser è molto semplice: e non solo nel caso di Chrome ma anche di altri browser.Il password manager del browser, però, è uno strumento comodo da usare e sempre pronto: per questo la stragrande maggioranza degli utenti continua a servirsene; spesso attivando anche la sincronizzazione di Chrome e quindi lo scambio dei dati personali, credenziali comprese, tra più dispositivi.In occasione del World Password Day abbiamo visto come creare password sicure e qual è il ruolo ricoperto dall'autenticazione a due fattori.La novità è che Chrome non soltanto sarà presto in grado di rilevare le password 'compromesse' ovvero quelle già nelle mani dei criminali informatici (cosa possibile già oggi) ma provvederà a cambiare le password insicure in automatico.La notizia può suonare un po’ sinistra.",

Una prassi che genera confusione e fa perdere di vista la comunicazione importante a partire dalla quale hanno avuto inizio le reazioni degli utenti.Con notevole ritardo rispetto ad applicazioni come Telegram, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, agli stessi messaggi RCS supportati da Google (l'evoluzione degli SMS) e così via anche WhatsApp si arricchisce finalmente delle reazioni: le varie emoji verranno d'ora in avanti raggruppate in modo ordinato sotto ciascun messaggio, un po’ come si vede nell'immagine pubblicata di seguito.\n\nL'utilizzo delle reazioni su WhatsApp è possibile solo assicurandosi di aver aggiornato il client di messaggistica all'ultima versione disponibile.",

Traducibile in italiano con il termine Chiave prodotto, il Product Key è un codice alfanumerico che identifica in modo univoco un software. Ricordiamo che possedere un Product Key non implica disporre di una licenza.Una licenza per usare Windows, Office o altri software si ottiene se il Product Key è acquisito mediante canali legittimi. Capita spesso di imbattersi online in venditori senza scrupoli che commercializzano Product Key rubati oppure provenienti da contratti a volume che le aziende hanno stipulato con Microsoft.Quei codici Product Key potrebbero funzionare ovvero permettere l'attivazione di Windows per brevi periodi o finestre temporali più lunghe ma in ogni caso espongono a rischi (anche sul piano legale) i soggetti che li utilizzano. Abbiamo visto dove trovare le migliori offerte software 2022 tra cui anche quelle sui sistemi operativi come Windows 10 e Windows 11.\nNiente Product Key: Windows 10 è attivato con una licenza digitale\n In vista dell'aggiornamento a Windows 11 oppure per semplici finalità di backup spesso si ha l'esigenza di recuperare il Product Key di Windows 10.Innanzi tutto diciamo che il modo migliore per non avere problemi con le licenze di Windows è legare l'installazione del sistema operativo con il proprio account utente Microsoft.Se Windows 10 o Windows 11 sono attivati (e lo si può verificare digitando Impostazioni attivazione nella casella di ricerca del sistema operativo, il consiglio è quello di digitare Gestisci il tuo account, cliccare su Le tue info nella colonna di sinistra e assicurarsi di usare un account amministratore.Se sotto il nome dell'account amministratore compare un indirizzo email, significa che si sta già usando un account utente Microsoft per accedere a Windows.",
