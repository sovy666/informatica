(B) I haven't used a Linux desktop in over a Decade & a lot has changed, but I am trying to learn. (C) I tried googling this & my issues seems to be unique.\n I can't get my Steam Deck to recognize any USB wired input devices. Bluetooth works fine, but directly connecting a USB device (either through a dock or directly plugging in a single device with a USB-C to USB-C cable). Display out works when connecting a Dock, all devices I plug in directly will light up and start charging from the Deck, but no input devices are detected by the system.\n I have tried two different Docks, two sets of KB+M (my gaming ones off my main PC and a generic Dell Set), an 8BitDo SN30 game pad, and a Rii i8 mini KB+trackpad.\n None of them will show up when connected through USB, but both my Gaming mouse from corsair & the SN30 worked fine when connect through Bluetooth. The only things I have done with Desktop mode is try out Heroic Game Launcher and Lutris, install flat seal, and install ProtonUp-QT ... All done through the discovery application.\n The over all symptoms of this make me think that some kind of permission for USB PnP detection got turned off, but I don't know enough about Linux to start guessing at where to find those: any suggestions for how to fix this?\n    submitted by    /u/Xijit  \n [link]   [comments]",

A Systemd service seems reasonable to do this.\n There are several old topics on this issue on Fedora mailing list e.g. but I cannot get it to work.\n https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/users/2011-December/409819.html\n It also seems this guy used Systemd in the wrong way according to many comments that you find on Google on this topic. Systemd does not wait for the script to be finished. Executing the script manually does exactly what it's intended for.\n Is there a proper way to suspend the machines?On the Arch wiki there is this section https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/VMware#Suspend_virtual_machines_before_host_suspend/hibernatebut the script doesn't get triggered on Sway e.g. when I poweroff the host although I copied it to\n /usr/lib/systemd/system-shutdown/vmware-suspend-all.sh \n giving it +x execution permissions for any user. \n Edit: It seems /usr/lib/systemd/system-shutdown/ is also not correct as this happens when the system already is mounted read only.\n Did you figure out how it works reliably?\n    submitted by    /u/cmprmsd  \n [link]   [comments]",

I also (obviously) read the wiki pages for building ISOs and older Reddit posts on the topic, but it still is extremely confusing and I don't really know what I'm doing wrong, I just followed the wiki and later some tutorial videos on the subject. I consider myself an advanced user and have been using Linux for the past two years as my main OS. \n I wanted an Arch ISO running Cinnamon with some custom themes, pamac and the Calamares Installer. Do you have any suggestions on where to begin my search, like more documentation, tutorial videos or the like?\n    submitted by    /u/AugustBrasilien  \n [link]   [comments]",

I still have the last available kernel release in my secondary slot, which I bounce to when suspend issues come up, and have been using graysky's build for the hrtimer tweaks for the up-to-date kernel releases.\n Just checking in to see what the consensus is on the \"best\" maintained scheduler (or desktop kernel builds in general), and if anything out there plays a similar role. My current laptop is quite the potato, so I'd like to think tailored kernels are the way to go in my use case.
