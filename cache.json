          "description": "Hello all,\n Posting this Firefox problem on r/Arch because that is the only instance where I experience this problem. That said, it may not be an Arch problem at all, but I had to start somewhere.\n ​\n The problem is that Firefox freezes frequently, and for sevaral seconds at a time, on one of my PCs. Active tab is frozen, and can't switch to any other. After several seconds a tab responds, and makes FF essentially useless. This happens only on one machine.\n ​\n I run Firefox on KDE. I have three instances:\n - Arch vfio VM w/nvidia\n - Fedora Spin vfio VM with custom repo for kde latest, w/nvidia\n - Arch on System76 laptop w/intel/nvida, using Optimus Manager in hybrid mode\n ​\n The two VMs are configured the same with all respects except for OS. I only run one or the other at a time. There are no tweaks applied to Firefox on any instance other than add-ons.\n ​\n The VMs are my daily drivers, and ideally it would be the Arch VM. But since Firefox is unusable essentially on that VM,I am using Fedora until I can solve this problem.\n ​\n Things that I have tried on the Arch VM:\n - reviewed the Arch Wiki entry for solutions\n - Safe mode\n - clear clache\n - move cache to ramdisk\n - create new profile\n - Remove FF and ~/.mozilla and /.cache/mozilla directories, reinstall and create a, new profile.\n After each of these changes, the freezing problem always returned at some point.\n ​\n I am out of ideas. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/basil_not_the_plant  \n [link]   [comments]",

I believe this to be the culprit because I've read others are having issues with this driver, but I've downgraded all my NVIDIA packages (\"nvidia\", \"nvidia-utils\", lib32-nvidia-utils\") back to the version before 510.60.2, and the issue persists.\n My machine sports an i7-6700, GTX 1070, 16GB RAM on an SSD.

Also sometimes getting RO filesystem type crashes that may or may not be related.\n I've been doing the following:\n journalctl -b -r -p 1..4 > errors.md and looking for an insertion point for troubleshooting, but it's hard to say what is critical and what isn't without some deeper knowledge of how the kernel is working / supposed to work.\n Dell Precision 5550 only has USB-C inputs and most of the errors are not reproducible in some way that lends itself to easy diagnostics. I updated the BIOS last week and everything is up to date, but the crashes persist and instability persists, especially when there are devices connected to the USB-C ports.\n Is there somewhere else to look or something to be done before I just RMA the machine and use a desktop instead? Really some description of the process is what I'm looking for more than just \"the answer\", which I'm happy to put in the foot miles to get. I'll put the output of the journal log in the comments.\n I would think it was something I'm doing wrong except these problems sometimes happen during POST and I get multiple sequential reboots even before drive decrypt which makes me think I've got a hardware/firmware problem.\n    submitted by    /u/dream_weasel  \n [link]   [comments]",

Checking helvum/pavucontrol the USB audio devices for the onboard jacks will show up just fine when things are plugged into them but they just don't seem to make noise or take in the input.\n If I plug my headphones into the headphone jack it will show up in the appropriate places and pavu's meter for that sink will react to the audio going to it, however I don't actually hear anything. Similarly, if I plug something into the line-in/mic jacks they will show up as plugged in in pavu but the meter doesn't react at all.

Nuove funzionalità 'inedite' aggiungeranno nuovi livelli di protezione contro le minacce, offriranno una migliore crittografia e aiuteranno a bloccare app e driver dannosi.L'obiettivo dell'azienda di Redmond è quello di combinare più livelli di protezione, dall'hardware fino al cloud.Una delle nuove caratteristiche vocate alla sicurezza che Microsoft sta inserendo in Windows 11 è una maggiore protezione contro gli attacchi phishing mirati ovvero le aggressori progettate dai criminali informatici che hanno l'obiettivo di bersagliare una singola azienda o un professionista. Il nuovo sistema antiphishing sarà integrato in Microsoft Defender SmartScreen e sarà basato sull'intelligenza derivante dal cloud.Dal momento che, come sappiamo, SmartScreen è integrato a livello di sistema operativo, gli utenti di Windows 11 saranno avvertiti quando proveranno a inserire le loro credenziali in applicazioni dannose o siti Web violati.",

Eppure il monitor del PC è lo strumento con cui si è maggiormente a contatto, tutti i giorni: acquistare un monitor qualità significa facilitare la lettura e diminuire significativamente lo stress visivo.Scegliere un monitor per PC può però rivelarsi cosa terribilmente complicata: spesso è difficile scegliere i prodotti che meglio si adattano alle proprie esigenze e aspettative.Se avete spesso gli occhi stanchi è bene scegliere bene il monitor per PC, posizionarlo correttamente e, talvolta, fare attenzione anche all'uso di temi scuri che non sono - diversamente da quello che scrivono in tanti - la soluzione per tutti i mali.\nMonitor PC: le caratteristiche del pannello\n I monitor per PC che trovate ad esempio su Amazon Italia possono utilizzare svariate tecnologie.In generale, però, si ha a che fare con monitor a pannello TFT (Thin Film Transistor) composti da un substrato di materiale semiconduttore trasparente depositato sulle superfici interne dei vetri che ospitano anche i cristalli liquidi.La specifica tecnologia utilizzabile per fabbricare il pannello del monitor può invece fare capo a diverse categorie ma generalmente i monitor per PC sono di tre tipologie: TN (Twisted Nematic), IPS (In Plane Switching) o VA (Vertical Alignment).I termini TN, IPS e VA tendono a passare inosservati tra le specifiche dei monitor quando invece la tecnologia realizzativa dei pannelli è la chiave per scegliere prodotti di qualità.\nI pannelli TN\n I pannelli di tipo TN esistono da tanti anni.",

          "description": "Era il 4 aprile 1975, 47 anni fa, quando l'allora ventenne Bill Gates e l'amico Paul Allen, di due anni più grande di lui, fondarono Microsoft. Fu un'intuizione geniale, un'azienda che si sarebbe concentrata solo sullo sviluppo di sistemi operativi, quando allora si calcola che in circolazione non ci fossero più di 2.000 computer.Gates non è partito da zero, certo. Proveniva da una famiglia dell'alta borghesia di Seattle che gli ha permesso di svolgere una carriera da studente senza troppe preoccupazioni e di investire nella sua impresa. Il padre di Gates era un importante avvocato e sua madre faceva parte di diversi consigli di amministrazione. Lui e i suoi primi collaboratori avevano accesso a tecnologie che all'epoca non erano disponibili per la maggior parte delle persone.La stoffa di Gates c'era tutta: il ragazzo era brillante, aveva un quoziente intellettivo sopra la media e, complice anche l'amicizia con Allen, fu subito amore con i computer.Da studente, collaborando con Allen, si mise a sviluppare un programma per gestire gli orari delle lezioni: fu talmente riuscito che Gates fu premiato con una ricca borsa di studio da ben 500 dollari, una somma davvero importante per quel periodo.\n\nNella foto Paul Allen e Bill Gates presso la Lakeside School (1970).",

Questi 'mini computer' offrono prestazioni convincenti pur occupando uno spazio ridottissimo sulla scrivania, in negozio, nei salotti e ovunque sia indispensabile servirsi di un sistema dalle dimensioni compatte.La prossima gamma di Mini PC si chiama NUC Studio 12 ed è conosciuta con il nome in codice di Wall Street Canyon.Il numero 12 si riferisce al fatto che i nuovi NUC saranno equipaggiati con i processori Alder Lake di dodicesima generazione. La scelta cadrà su versioni con TDP pari a 28W con gli utenti business che potranno optare anche per i modelli vPro.\n\nStando alle prime informazioni, la linea NUC Studio 12 comprenderà dispositivi che, nella versione più performante, useranno un processore Core i7-1270P con 12 core fisici e 16 thread oltre alla grafica Iris Xe.In alternativa saranno proposte versioni con Intel Core i7-1260P, Core i5-1250P, Core i5-1240P e Core i3-1220P.NUC Studio 12 e NUC Studio 12 Pro saranno al solito Mini PC estremamente compatti (11x11 cm) con l'altezza che varia a seconda della versione.Il nuovo telaio presenta una parte superiore con supporto per la ricarica wireless Qi: l'utente potrà ricaricare la batteria dello smartphone o di un altro dispositivo mobile compatibile semplicemente appoggiandolo sul Mini PC.All'interno del dispositivo due slot SODIMM con supporto per RAM DDR4-3200 (64 GB di capacità totale).",

Il passaggio da un operatore di telecomunicazioni all'altro è quindi molto più facile e veloce così come la sottoscrizione di servizi aggiuntivi.I dati della SIM virtuale sono inoltre memorizzati sul cloud rendendo più facile l'uso su diversi dispositivi semplicemente inserendo le credenziali dell'utente.Tutti i vantaggi possono essere estesi dagli smartphone ai PC fino ai dispositivi indossabili e all'Internet delle Cose (IoT).Per usare due numeri mobili su un unico dispositivo fino ad oggi la soluzione consisteva nell'uso di una doppia SIM con i telefoni che supportano questo schema.",
