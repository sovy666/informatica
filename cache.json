          "description": "Just got out from trying to fix my arch install for hours after a gnome update, maybe someone else had the same problems.\n Been using Arch in HyperV Enhanced session mode with the same config for years with no problem, but among the last updates of gnome it just broke. The xrdp login shows like always, but after login the HyperV window says the connection dropped.\n Gnome was configured to start in .xinitrc in X11 mode. Xrdp sesman log just says the window manager exited with code 255 and signal 5, and that it exited quickly immediately.\n Tried fresh install in new VM with default xrdp and xorgxrdp. Config changed to use vsock and to not use encryption in rdp. Issue persists. Changed from gnome to xfce4 and everything works without issue\n Decided to stick with xfce4 after that, but thought maybe someone could shed some light on it. Or just to prevent someone else to waste time fixing their install\n    submitted by    /u/TodHeartbreaker  \n [link]   [comments]",

I like challenges and learning and on Linux Mint there is nothing really to learn. And that's why I'm considering switching to Arch, I think it will give me a better understanding of Linux and hopefully teach me something. You know, it's a little different when you just flash Linux Mint into your PC, and when you have to build the whole operating system from scratch, even with the instruction. But I know Arch is not easy, especially for someone who is not on Linux for a long time. I will learn a bit first, try to install it on my other PC which is basically for testing things and then after some time of learning switch to Arch entirely. But still I would love to hear from more advanced and experienced users some tips or general advice. Even the stupidest shit might be useful for me. So that's basically what I'm asking for, general advice, maybe some not that obvious information about how things work on Arch, no noes, things that would make the switch easier, things that you wish you would know before you have switched to Arch etc.\n Thanks in advance for every reply :)\n    submitted by    /u/korupcja  \n [link]   [comments]",

I reset my panels and set them up again, but it didn't change anything for me, I tired a wayland session, which did allow me to change the keyboard layout again, but didn't solve any of the other problems.\n However, as I had to get back to work, I downgraded all my packages via the arch archive to 2022-05-12 (the time I ran the last time updates) and since then everything runs smooth.\n Here the list of packages I've upgraded today (and now downgraded): https://pastebin.com/GZq8AF2n\n Do you guys experience the same problems?

I read the Arch wiki in all details.In Firefox with rdd sandbox deactivated it works well... until it didn't while the video played. I don't know why. Right now after reboot it works.\n Playback with mpv doesn't work but it worked before. mpv.conf is set to activate vaapi but it worked without hassle before I set it there. Playing back with Haruna, which uses mpv, doesn't use vaapi until I open settings and navigate to playback where I set it to vaapi, then it uses surprinsingly the hardware decode units. Maybe less than it should but I'm not sure about that.\n What the hell is going on? I get the Firefox thing, which will be hopefully resolved in the near future. But everything in all it works until it doesn't. It's so unstable.I could try it once more in Wayland but back then it didn't.\n    submitted by    /u/Deinorius  \n [link]   [comments]",

On reboot, Grub complains that the vmlinuz image cant be found.\n After a reboot from an USB with my Arch stick (with zfs), I was able to import and mount the zpool. All my files in /home is there, and the rest of the Linux files too. But /boot is empty except for the grub files. No initrd or vmlinuz files to be found.\n # zpool list\n zroot 446G 51G 392G ...\n # mkdir /zzz\n There is two zfs filesystems, the root fs and a home fs. Both are shown when I do an zfs list\n zroot\n zroot/rootfs /zzz\n zroot/rootfs/home /zzz/home\n The disk also have an EFI partition, but it is not used for kernel images. The only files there are related to EFI itself.\n # zfs get mountpoint\n List of the root filesystem and all snapshots. Looks good including the snapshot I made before the (failed) update today.\n zfs mount -a\n # arch-chroot /zzz\n ls -l /boot\n NADA\n What now? Do I need to redo the (quite complex) linux+zfs installation, or is there some way to recover.\n    submitted by    /u/andersostling56  \n [link]   [comments]",

Se le stesse pagine vengono visitate da indirizzi IP europei il totale scende a poco più di 1.800 casi.Alla base del problema vi è l'utilizzo di componenti traccianti che monitorano l'attività dei visitatori, compongono profili individuali, registrano le interazioni con la pagina e mantengono un identificativo persistente in modo da individuare lo stesso utente durante le successive sessioni.Molti dei tracker in questione utilizzano script che monitorano le sequenze di tasti premute all'interno dei moduli e salvano il contenuto.",

          "description": "È stata forse la prima infezione globale da ransomware della storia. Cinque anni fa, a maggio del 2017, cominciava il viaggio di una minaccia nota come WannaCry tra i sistemi informatici di mezzo mondo. Il malware in questione sfruttava una vulnerabilità scoperta nell'implementazione del protocollo SMB in Windows.Acronimo di Server Message Block, SMB è un protocollo comunemente utilizzato per condividere file, stampanti, porte seriali e comunicazioni di varia natura tra diversi nodi di una rete.Facendo leva sulla mancata applicazione della patch MS17-010, che nel frattempo Microsoft aveva rilasciato, WannaCry si diffondeva all'interno della rete locale andando alla ricerca di tutti i sistemi vulnerabili.Dal momento che nel 2017, come oggi, sono pochi i sistemi direttamente esposti sulla rete Internet (quindi senza protezione firewall/NAT), l'infezione aveva generalmente inizio con un doppio clic su un allegato malevolo ricevuto via email.Per dare un'idea dei danni causati 5 anni fa da WannaCry, basti pensare che il ransomware è riuscito a crittografare con una chiave tenuta segreta oltre 230.000 computer in 150 Paesi.",

Il TGP dovrebbe attestarsi sui 450W.Con la versione 'Ti', il chip grafico potrebbe essere quindi ancora più potente e spingersi fino a un massimo di 18.432 shader.",
