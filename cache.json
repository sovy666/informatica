I used airblader’s i3-gaps wm (I’m looking to switch to bspwm for arch linux) and used polybar for a taskbar. I don’t think I have any need for a desktop environment, since I don’t need a “bundle” of stuff if I can somehow assemble all the individual parts I need together. \n Are there alternatives to a desktop environment? I’m not sure exactly how I can get a gui to work without one. What other parts do I need? Guides seem scarce as it seems most people just install Gnome. \n This is new ground for me. Sorry if I sound like a noob right now. Any help would be appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/SOGIST  \n [link]   [comments]",

When i tried to run it my monitors went black with an \"out of range\" message on it and it persists after rebooting. The SDDM animation displays as normal on boot but then when I'd normally get to the KDE desktop i get the black screens again. I was able to hear Firefox start playing a video due to random luck pressing buttons during the black screen, so i'm sure its running I think its just stuck in a display setting that isn't working.\n I've tried editing the kernel parameters and adding nomodeset, also tried specifying the resolution and refresh rate of my monitor there and it doesn't help. I've tried unplugging and plugging the monitors, booting with just one monitor connected, none of it has made a difference. Any suggestions on how to get back to my desktop? I'm using systemdboot and X11 if that makes any difference. Thanks.\n Edit: Finally fixed it. Booted with the kernel parameter 3 in order to boot to the command line and deleted everything in ~/.local/share/kscreen\n Now working after a reboot.\n    submitted by    /u/Mojo_Ryzen  \n [link]   [comments]",

That said, it may not be an Arch problem at all, but I had to start somewhere.\n ​\n The problem is that Firefox freezes frequently, and for sevaral seconds at a time, on one of my PCs. Active tab is frozen, and can't switch to any other. After several seconds a tab responds, and makes FF essentially useless. This happens only on one machine.\n ​\n I run Firefox on KDE. I have three instances:\n - Arch vfio VM w/nvidia\n - Fedora Spin vfio VM with custom repo for kde latest, w/nvidia\n - Arch on System76 laptop w/intel/nvida, using Optimus Manager in hybrid mode\n ​\n The two VMs are configured the same with all respects except for OS. I only run one or the other at a time. There are no tweaks applied to Firefox on any instance other than add-ons.\n ​\n The VMs are my daily drivers, and ideally it would be the Arch VM. But since Firefox is unusable essentially on that VM,I am using Fedora until I can solve this problem.\n ​\n Things that I have tried on the Arch VM:\n - reviewed the Arch Wiki entry for solutions\n - Safe mode\n - clear clache\n - move cache to ramdisk\n - create new profile\n - Remove FF and ~/.mozilla and /.cache/mozilla directories, reinstall and create a, new profile.\n After each of these changes, the freezing problem always returned at some point.\n ​\n I am out of ideas. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/basil_not_the_plant  \n [link]   [comments]",

Also sometimes getting RO filesystem type crashes that may or may not be related.\n I've been doing the following:\n journalctl -b -r -p 1..4 > errors.md and looking for an insertion point for troubleshooting, but it's hard to say what is critical and what isn't without some deeper knowledge of how the kernel is working / supposed to work.\n Dell Precision 5550 only has USB-C inputs and most of the errors are not reproducible in some way that lends itself to easy diagnostics. I updated the BIOS last week and everything is up to date, but the crashes persist and instability persists, especially when there are devices connected to the USB-C ports.\n Is there somewhere else to look or something to be done before I just RMA the machine and use a desktop instead? Really some description of the process is what I'm looking for more than just \"the answer\", which I'm happy to put in the foot miles to get. I'll put the output of the journal log in the comments.\n I would think it was something I'm doing wrong except these problems sometimes happen during POST and I get multiple sequential reboots even before drive decrypt which makes me think I've got a hardware/firmware problem.\n    submitted by    /u/dream_weasel  \n [link]   [comments]",

A parte gli smartphone e i tablet, non si contano i portatili e anche i sistemi desktop che integrano il supporto Bluetooth.Se state cercando una buona cassa Bluetooth siete certamente alla ricerca di un prodotto versatile, spesso compatto, facile da trasportare e riposizionare dove meglio si crede.Il mercato offre oggi centinaia di modelli di speaker Bluetooth, alcuni contraddistinti da un ottimo rapporto qualità/prezzo.Di seguito offriamo alcuni spunti per scegliere la migliore cassa Bluetooth per le proprie esigenze lasciando poi al lettore ulteriori approfondimenti.In un altro articolo abbiamo visto cos'è Bluetooth e le differenze con BLE.Bluetooth è uno standard di connettività wireless punto-punto o punto-multipunto nelle sue versioni più recenti che permette di creare facilmente delle reti personali senza fili (PAN, Personal Area Network).Bluetooth opera sulla frequenza dei 2,4 GHz e permette la trasmissione di una quantità limitata di informazioni: la larghezza di banda è limitata (fino a 2,1 Mbps) ma è più che sufficiente per trasmettere audio in alta qualità.",

Dal 2006 lo sviluppo di Tor è gestito da un ente senza scopo di lucro ed è cresciuto di anno in anno fino ad essere scelto ogni giorno da milioni di utenti in tutto il mondo.Oggi la comunità di sviluppo di Tor ha annunciato che entro settembre 2022 dovrebbe debuttare la prima versione stabile di Arti, un client non più scritto in C bensì in Rust.Rust è un linguaggio di programmazione compilato sviluppato da Mozilla Research in collaborazione con la comunità open source il cui obiettivo primario è quello di consentire la realizzazione di sistemi complessi altamente sicuri, anche multithreaded.L'attuale client multipiattaforma di Tor non morirà a breve ma in futuro verrà certamente accantonato.",

Esistono software gratuiti come BrowsingHistoryView che recuperano la cronologia di qualunque browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Chromium e derivati) per qualsiasi account configurato su una macchina locale o remota.Per evitare di far sapere agli altri utenti cosa si sta cercando, si dovrebbe quindi usare sempre la navigazione in incognito del browser: in questo modo le pagine Web visitate e tutti gli elementi in esse presenti non saranno memorizzate né a livello di cronologia né di cache locale.Per 'spaccare il capello' ed evitare che altri soggetti possano risalire agli URL dei siti Web visitati anche nella modalità di navigazione in incognito è possibile attivare l'uso del protocollo DNS over HTTPS (DoH) che provvede a crittografare tutte le richieste di risoluzione dei nomi a dominio.",

La società guidata da Lisa Su ha aggiunto che fornirà maggiori informazioni sulla questione 'il più presto possibile'.Il bug interessa soltanto i computer con una scheda grafica Radeon e un processore Ryzen: questi ultimi sono controllati tramite il software Adrenalin che integra una sorta di modulo software (Ryzen Master) utilizzato per modificare vari aspetti del funzionamento del processore senza dover entrare nel BIOS.Il tutto è governato dalla funzione chiamate Precision Boost Overdrive (PBO) che si occupa di regolare tensioni e frequenze 'al volo' per l'overclock con un semplice clic.L'overclocking automatico del processore causato dall'installazione del driver Adrenalin più aggiornato non è di per sé un grosso problema perché l'aumento delle frequenze operative appare piuttosto contenuto.",

Il nuovo sistema antiphishing sarà integrato in Microsoft Defender SmartScreen e sarà basato sull'intelligenza derivante dal cloud.Dal momento che, come sappiamo, SmartScreen è integrato a livello di sistema operativo, gli utenti di Windows 11 saranno avvertiti quando proveranno a inserire le loro credenziali in applicazioni dannose o siti Web violati.",

Eppure il monitor del PC è lo strumento con cui si è maggiormente a contatto, tutti i giorni: acquistare un monitor qualità significa facilitare la lettura e diminuire significativamente lo stress visivo.Scegliere un monitor per PC può però rivelarsi cosa terribilmente complicata: spesso è difficile scegliere i prodotti che meglio si adattano alle proprie esigenze e aspettative.Se avete spesso gli occhi stanchi è bene scegliere bene il monitor per PC, posizionarlo correttamente e, talvolta, fare attenzione anche all'uso di temi scuri che non sono - diversamente da quello che scrivono in tanti - la soluzione per tutti i mali.\nMonitor PC: le caratteristiche del pannello\n I monitor per PC che trovate ad esempio su Amazon Italia possono utilizzare svariate tecnologie.In generale, però, si ha a che fare con monitor a pannello TFT (Thin Film Transistor) composti da un substrato di materiale semiconduttore trasparente depositato sulle superfici interne dei vetri che ospitano anche i cristalli liquidi.La specifica tecnologia utilizzabile per fabbricare il pannello del monitor può invece fare capo a diverse categorie ma generalmente i monitor per PC sono di tre tipologie: TN (Twisted Nematic), IPS (In Plane Switching) o VA (Vertical Alignment).I termini TN, IPS e VA tendono a passare inosservati tra le specifiche dei monitor quando invece la tecnologia realizzativa dei pannelli è la chiave per scegliere prodotti di qualità.\nI pannelli TN\n I pannelli di tipo TN esistono da tanti anni.",

Queste immagini “AI generate” possono poi essere usate, per esempio, in un sito di incontri per spacciarsi per una persona reale di bell’aspetto e tentare qualche truffa. Mi è così capitato di provare l’estensione, disponibile solo per Chrome e i browser basati su Chromium, Fake Profile Detector, sviluppata da V7 Labs, che è in grado di riconoscere le immagini fasulle generate usando il metodo StyleGAN. Al momento non è in grado di riconoscere fotomontaggi o video fasulli.
