          "description": "Hi. Recently i found a great feature about mounting sshfs on deman, so I tried to set it up and found a strange problem. I mounted some servers to the /home/igormahov/sshfs/server1, .../server2, etc. When I'm using Dolphin and visiting my home directory, it tries to \"ping\" all these mounts by mounting them and unmounting immediately. The problem is that there is one server which is turned off most of the time and the \"ping\" for it hangs, causing the freeze of the Dolphin and the whole filesystem. The only temporary solution is to kill all ps aux | grep sshfs processes and to forcibly umount this directory (without unmounting, the Dolphin tries to \"ping\" it again after the refresh of files list). Is there any way to get rid of this problem?\n    submitted by    /u/Igormahov  \n [link]   [comments]",
