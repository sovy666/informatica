With almost 400 packages while I actively use approximately only about half of this number responding to \"b0rked\", \"needs update\" requests is less fun than one could imagine. Of course I could simply disown all I no longer use but I would like to take more responsible approach - see if I can get anybody else interested, add as a co-maintainer and then if it works well for some period of time step down. If you want to know if you use any of the PKGBUILDs I maintain you can run the following snippet in bash (aurutils, jq required):\n pacman -Qq | grep -xf <((aur search -r -m jose1711 | jq -r '.results|.[].Name')) \n If you're interested in anything, please leave me a message at https://aur.archlinux.org/account/jose1711.

The program itself is not very complicated to install, just a single Python script to copy into a directory.\n Prior in generating the package, I have to update the checksum in PKGBUILD, upload the current state of the project to Github, create a release with a tag and change the version in the PKGBUILD file. Then I can use makepkg to build the package and upload it too in the release tab. Then one can download the \"tochd-x.x-x-any.pkg.tar.zst\" package from release page and install using pacman.\n Am I doing this right? The program itself is working correctly and I tested it by installing it myself (obviously). Just a note here about the program itself: It is more or less a commandline interface to automate extraction archives with 7z and convert certain types of files (such as .iso or .cue) with chdman.

I nuovi core 'LPE' sarebbero core a bassa potenza che permetteranno di ridurre ancora i consumi energetici con particolare attenzione al mercato consumer.L'informazione arriva da alcune slide che sono venute a galla in queste ore: i dettagli tecnici potrebbero risultare piuttosto approssimativi anche perché Intel non usa più termini come '7nm' per riferirsi ai processi costruttivi utilizzati.",

          "description": "Ricorderete certamente le aggressioni informatiche subìte a più riprese da personaggi di spicco possessori di iPhone e altri dispositivi Apple. Tra le ultime minacce lo spyware Pegasus sviluppato dagli israeliani di NSO Group e venduto a enti governativi di mezzo mondo.I vertici e i tecnici di Apple hanno sempre gettato acqua sul fuoco dicendo che si è trattato di attacchi molto limitati e sferrati verso obiettivi di elevato profilo.La società di Cupertino ha però deciso di implementare le necessarie contromisure di sicurezza: la nuova Lockdown Mode è una funzionalità di protezione che verrà integrata in iOS 16, iPadOS 16 e macOS Ventura con il preciso scopo di difendere giornalisti, dissidenti e altri individui 'sensibili' da attacchi spyware mirati.Una volta abilitata, la modalità di blocco fornirà ai clienti Apple un livello di protezione aggiuntivo durante l'utilizzo della messaggistica, della navigazione Web e del traffico dati impedendo il funzionamento di spyware come Pegasus.I tentativi di compromissione dei dispositivi Apple utilizzando exploit zero-click mirati (per sfruttare ad esempio vulnerabilità sconosciute insite nelle app di messaggistica come WhatsApp e FaceTime o nei browser Web) verranno automaticamente bloccati proprio grazie a Lockdown Mode: le funzionalità potenzialmente sfruttabili dagli aggressori vengono infatti puntualmente disattivate.L'attivazione di Lockdown Mode in iOS 16, iPadOS 16 e macOS Ventura rafforza ulteriormente le difese dei dispositivi Apple e limita severamente il 'raggio d'azione' di alcune funzionalità.",

Queste porzioni di dati vengono chiamati pacchetti e ciascuno di essi, oltre al payload ovvero i dati veri e propri da trasferire, consta di un'intestazione o header.L'header contiene l'indirizzo del trasmettitore, quello del ricevitore, la vita del pacchetto, i dati che riguardano l'assemblaggio con gli altri pacchetti e così via.Per raggiungere il dispositivo (host) di destinazione i pacchetti imboccano una o più strade a seconda delle indicazioni contenute nelle tabelle di instradamento o tabelle di routing.L'insieme di protocolli utilizzati per una rete a commutazione di pacchetto qual è Internet si chiama TCP/IP ed è nato nel 1981.Quando non tutti i pacchetti dati arrivano a destinazione, TCP si occupa di inviare nuovamente i pacchetti persi o danneggiati.",

          "description": "Le unità a stato solido o SSD si basano sull'uso di memorie flash NAND non volatili. Come nel caso di un hard disk magnetomeccanico gli SSD possono memorizzare i dati che rimangono conservati anche dopo il completo spegnimento del dispositivo. Il principale vantaggio delle unità SSD è che non hanno parti in movimento e non fanno affidamento su di una testina per leggere e scrivere le informazioni.L'utilizzo di un'interfaccia veloce, come PCI Express, per il trasferimento dati consente performance impensabili con gli hard disk tradizionali.In un altro articolo abbiamo riassunto le principali differenze tra hard disk e SSD.La connessione PCI Express di quinta generazione può trasmettere fino a 4 GB/s di dati in parallelo per pin di dati. Ciò significa che le unità a stato solido di tipo M.2 che utilizzano una variante a 4 corsie dello standard saranno in grado di trasmettere fino a 16 GB/s di dati .",

Ma non è possibile acquistare un prodotto che sia in grado di supportare i processori di entrambe le aziende? La risposta breve è: no, oggi non è possibile farlo.Prima ancora che tecnico il motivo è legale: sia Intel che AMD si coprono le spalle con apposite clausole che evitano la progettazione, la realizzazione e l'immissione sul mercato di schede madri con due socket e chipset diversi al fine di supportare l'utilizzo dei processori di entrambi i produttori.Va detto che arrivare oggi a una 'scheda madre universale' sarebbe inoltre piuttosto complesso dal punto di vista architetturale: bisognerebbe adattare il funzionamento di tutti i componenti a due sistemi Intel-AMD che gestiscono le tensioni in modi del tutto differenti.Anche la gestione della memoria RAM sarebbe notevolmente diversa nonostante possano essere utilizzati gli stessi slot.C'è poi l'aspetto più evidente: dal punto di vista fisico nessun socket di AMD e Intel è sovrapponibile.",
