          "description": "Fairly recently switched from ubuntu-based distros to arch-based and a main reason was the package management. Now that I am here I am having a bit of issues with the workflow. Is there any good information about efficient ways to search for and install packages?\n Either the terminal or a GUI works fine if I want to install a single, specific package. Otherwise I find it pretty frustrating and slow. \n I have repeatedly read advice that it's better to use the terminal but how do you do this without endless copy and pasting? With a GUI you can click click click to select what is desired. In the terminal it is very cumbersome. It's hard to read a list of dozens of results on the terminal. \n However both pamac-manager and especially octopi GUI package managers have a big problem which is that if you select multiple packages for install and there is a problem with any of them, the whole job fails. It's hard to figure out where the problem is. \n Also would like to learn about the different variations of the same package that are usually available and why I would choose one or the other. Is there a way to specify a preference? I have found that accidentally mixing them causes dependency issues. \n I would appreciate any advice or links to reading on the subject. The documentation for the package manager and related tools themselves do not seem really to contain this kind of information and not sure how or where to look.\n    submitted by    /u/sprayfoamparty  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am new here :D So I am trying to install arch on my laptop and everything is more or less straightforward except disk partition part, because I have two partitions on my nwme drive. One is being used by windows 11 another is for linux. So I have used ubuntu/ mint before, and I had really no problem installing them, but arc is fucking with my newb brain. Anyway first I have tried to do old fashioned comand line install and I have made partitions( boot/swap/file system) on /dev/nvme0n1p5(p1/p2/p3)but when I wanted to format them on the next step with the command, it would come back as partition is not existing. Ok, so then I used script to install, which also does not show partitions i created before. It shows there is free space but in selection it shows nothing. I booted back to windows just to format that unpartitioned space to exfat so I know which partition i need to work with, but this is where I left confused. Do i need to delete this partition? Should i split it in 3 partitions again for boot, swap and file system for arch or should i create just one and script will do the rest? I really dont want to delete all my partitions accidentally so I am asking for little help. Thanks 🙏\n    submitted by    /u/Royal_Mongoose2907  \n [link]   [comments]",

In breve si tratta di workstation virtuali che sfruttano lo stesso schema utilizzato con Windows 365 e permettono di utilizzare sistemi già preconfigurati con tutto ciò che è necessario per sviluppare applicazioni con i vari linguaggi, framework, piattaforme, componenti, editor, ambienti di programmazione e così via.\n\nGestire workstation utilizzate dagli sviluppatori per creare le applicazioni è oggi fondamentale per stare al passo con i ritmi dei moderni.",

In via puramente teorica WiFi 6 consente di raggiungere 9,6 Gbps di banda ma all'atto pratico un router WiFi 6 di medio livello potrebbe essere decisamente meno performante rispetto a un dispositivo WiFi 5 di alto profilo.Nel migliore dei casi un router WiFi 6 utilizzato con un client WiFi 6 2x2 può consentire il trasferimento dati in modalità wireless a 1 Gbps.",

          "description": "Chi ha vissuto l'informatica negli anni '90 certamente si ricorderà degli storici processori Mendocino di Intel immessi sul mercato nel 1998. Erano CPU Celeron che risultavano interessanti per le buone opportunità offerte agli appassionati di overclocking.Adesso anche AMD sceglie il nome Mendocino (si ispira a quello di una contea californiana, negli Stati Uniti) e lo fa per le sue nuove APU destinate ai notebook più efficienti ed economici. La conferma arriva all'apertura dei battenti del Computex 2022 di Taipei.I nuovi AMD Ryzen Mendocino sembrano piuttosto simili all'APU personalizzata Aerith che la società di Sunnyvale ha sviluppato per la console portatile Steam Deck di Valve.Mendocino includerà CPU, GPU e controller di memoria nello stesso pacchetto e sarà prodotta da TSMC su un moderno processo produttivo a 6 nm.AMD ha scelto in questo caso di utilizzare l'architettura Zen 2 e non la più aggiornata Zen 3 per motivi di costi e consumi proponendo modelli con 4 core fisici e 8 thread.Punto nodale è sicuramente la sezione grafica: AMD l'ha migliorata rispetto alle precedenti APU con grafica integrata basata su architettura RDNA2.Mendocino supporterà inoltre memorie LPDDR5 nelle configurazioni con bus di memoria a due (64 bit) o ​​quattro canali (128 bit).Il resto delle sue funzionalità di I/O, connettività e ottimizzazione dell'alimentazione sono le stesse utilizzate nella serie Ryzen 6000.\n\nIn termini di durata della batteria, AMD assicura che i computer basati su chip Mendocino potranno essere utilizzati per almeno 10 ore prima di necessitare di una ricarica.I primi sistemi basati su Ryzen Mendocino arriveranno sul mercato prima di Natale e si sa già che a utilizzarli saranno ad esempio i laptop Lenovo IdeaPad 1.I portatili equipaggiati con le APU Mendocino di AMD costeranno tra 399 e 699 euro e supporteranno sia Windows che Chrome OS.\nProcessori desktop AMD Ryzen 7000 e socket AM5\n Al Computex 2022 ampio spazio è stato riservato per la gamma di processori desktop AMD Ryzen 7000.",

Git is also system and content agnostic. This means that it can run on any platform, which makes it a highly useful and sought after tool for programmers and casual users alike.\n    \nOne issue with Git, however, is that it requires you to use a command-line utility to fully use its functions. This means that in order to use Git you need to learn a number of commands specific to it. However, if you are using Emacs there can be a better way.\n    \nMagit is a powerful front-end for Git in Emacs. It allows you to easily and seamlessly use Git in Emacs to create, manipulate and save Git repositories through simple Emacs keybindings. Not only that, Magit also automatically adapts existing Git repositories through its interface. This means that you can install Magit right now and immediately use it to manage version control.\n   \n\nContent\n\nHow Magit Works\nInstalling Magit\nUsing Magit\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n.toc{background-color:#f3f4f6;font-size:16px;font-weight:500;padding:1em;}.toc h4{text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase;font-size:0.9375rem;margin-bottom:1rem;}.toc ul{margin:0;padding:0;font-size:15px;}.toc-content{overflow-y:auto;max-height:600px;}.toc-content...
