My compositor is dwl, hopefully that isn't the issue.\n  \nSteam\n I know Steam isn't Wayland-native, and needs to run through Xwayland. When I try to start the application, it gives this error message: ``` Check your DISPLAY environment variable and make sure that you have enabled X. If you are running remotely, make sure that you have a remote connection which will allow an X connection.\n For more information visit https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4050-WOJB-0608 ```\n I've also tried to run it in the command line, setting DISPLAY=:0, but that doesn't make a difference. Xwayland is installed, of course.\n  \nDiscord\n As far as I've been able to figure out, Discord should run using these flags: discord --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland\n However, it simply crashes with this error message: ``` Discord 0.0.17 interface 'wl_output' has no event 4 tcmalloc: large alloc 1073741824 bytes == 0x21611af76000 @ 0x5635a7118d65 0x7f658edbb20f\n Failed to get crash dump id.

While the language has been refined over the years, they are still the same in spirit as they were 10+ years ago when I first read them. If you haven't done so, consider giving the Arch Linux overview a read.\n Yes, it does bother me when someone posts a thread to this sub questioning the quality of a product that they get at no cost, complaining about problems caused by upstream bugs, and also complaining about solutions offered by community members. It bothers me a great deal and if you have read and agree with the Arch Linux principles, it should bother you, too.\n I do respond to such threads with links to the wiki and snark, because I'm genuinely offended at the implications of such posts. The implication being that Arch isn't meeting the user's needs in certain areas, and that someone else is responsible for shoring up those shortcomings to fulfill their expectations. And what really gets my goat, is that what they often consider failures of the distro are actually features, in light of user centrality. It would be far more constructive for a user to check for/open bug reports, and would constitute an actual semblance of contribution to the community, instead of complaining.\n Edit: markdown\n    submitted by    /u/krakenfury_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A fine aprile 2022 il ricercatore Mor Davidovich ha individuato un metodo per acquisire privilegi SYSTEM su qualunque sistema Windows collegato a un dominio.Davidovich ha spiegato di aver 'assemblato' il codice proveniente da diversi tool preesistenti per sviluppare un'applicazione (KrbRelayUp), pubblicata su GitHub, che conente a un utente di acquistare privilegi che non gli competono.In un altro articolo abbiamo visto le differenze tra i privilegi SYSTEM e i diritti di amministratore in Windows.L'aspetto più rilevante della ricerca condotta da Davidovich è che l'acquisizione dei privilegi SYSTEM sui sistemi utilizzati in ambito aziendale funziona anche con la configurazione predefinita del dominio. L'esperto in un primo tempo ha fatto presente che l'attacco KrbRelayUp non andava in porto nel caso in cui l'amministratore di sistema avesse attivato la firma LDAP su Windows Server.Lunedì scorso Davidovich ha rilasciato una nuova versione del suo tool KrbRelayUp che porta all'ottenimento dei privilegi più elevati anche con firma LDAP abilitata.Pur confermando l'esistenza della problematica, Microsoft si è affrettata a precisare che l'attacco in questione non interessa i clienti che usano istanze di Azure Active Directory.KrbRelayUp può comunque aiutare eventuali aggressori a compromettere macchine virtuali Azure in ambienti Active Directory ibridi in cui i controller di dominio sono sincronizzati con Azure Active Directory.In una pagina di supporto appena pubblicata, Microsoft ha condiviso le metodologie per proteggersi dall'attacco KrbRelayUp.In generale, i tecnici dell'azienda di Redmond suggeriscono di attivare la firma LDAP, Extended Protection for Authentication (EPA) e impostare a 0 l'attributo MS-DS-Machine-Account-Quota.Una dimostrazione dell'attacco è stata pubblicata in questo post su Twitter..",

          "description": "La tendenza tra i produttori di processori è quella di utilizzare sempre di più i chiplet: essi permettono di realizzare sistemi di elaborazione più piccoli ed economici che hanno il vantaggio di garantire una maggiore efficienza energetica.I chiplet, racchiusi in un unico pacchetto (package), consentono anche di utilizzare processi costruttivi diversi consentendo di scalare la potenza di elaborazione in modo molto efficace.Parlando della storia dei processori AMD Ryzen abbiamo visto come l'abbandono del tradizionale approccio monolitico per abbracciare la filosofia MCM (multi-chip module) abbia di fatto decretato il rinnovato successo della società di Sunnyvale.Nel caso di NVidia in tanti ipotizzavano che l'architettura Hopper avrebbe utilizzato un design basato su chiplet. Così non è stato ed è altamente probabile che anche l'azienda di Jen Hsun Huang si metta, essa stessa, sulla scia di AMD.L'utilizzo di interconnessioni performanti tra chiplet è e resterà una sfida cruciale per il futuro.",

I criminali informatici utilizzano infatti ERMAC per sottrarre le credenziali altrui e trasferire fondi usando decine di servizi di online banking. La quota richiesta mensilmente dagli sviluppatori dà un'idea di quali possano essere i ricavi dei criminali.La novità è che ERMAC 2.0 porta a ben 467 il numero delle app Android supportate: ciò significa che il trojan è capace di rubare password e dati di accesso per la gestione di un gran numero di conti online di tanti istituti di credito a livello mondiale. Il malware è inoltre capace di trasferire fondi dai portafogli di criptovalute altrui.Uno strumento come ERMAC 2.0 viene sfruttato non soltanto per appropriarsi del denaro altrui ma anche per porre in essere varie forme di frodi finanziarie.Allo stato attuale ERMAC 2.0 viene integrato in app Android presentate come legittime oppure si prova ad aumentarne la diffusione attraverso la comparsa di falsi messaggi di avviso, durante la navigazione sul Web, che informano circa l'utilizzo di una versione obsoleta del browser.Lo spiegano i ricercatori di Cyble che descrivono nel dettaglio il comportamento di ERMAC 2.0.Il malware, una volta in esecuzione sul dispositivo Android della vittima, raccoglie l'elenco delle app installate e lo invia a un server Command and Control (C&C).",

          "description": "ProtonMail e ProtonVPN sono due servizi molto conosciuti: il primo è un servizio per lo scambio di email in forma cifrata che è stato fondato nel 2013 da alcuni ricercatori del CERN di Ginevra (Svizzera); il secondo è un servizio VPN che permette di stabilire un tunnel crittografato tra il dispositivo client dell'utente e un server remoto (i pacchetti dati vengono protetti e non possono essere monitorati, letti o modificati da parte di soggetti terzi). Come altri servizi VPN, anche ProtonVPN consente di superare censure, limitazioni geografiche, raggiungere siti Web e servizi diversamente non fruibili, proteggere i dati che si scambiano con i server remoti durante l'utilizzo di connessioni potenzialmente insicure (si pensi a reti WiFi pubbliche o aperte).Servizi quali ProtonMail e ProtonVPN sono erogati da un'azienda (Proton Technologies AG) con sede in Svizzera: essi si attengono alle normative del Paese elvetico e alla sua giurisdizione.Qualche tempo fa l'azienda fu costretta a comunicare l'indirizzo IP reale di un utente connesso con i suoi servizi tanto che quel comportamento destò un vespaio di polemiche e determinò l'arrivo del padre del World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee come responsabile per gli aspetti legati alla privacy.",

Il progetto è stato parzialmente portato a termine con il nuovo OneNote che già unisce i due mondi e include alcune nuove caratteristiche, con altre funzioni che saranno via via introdotte nei mesi a seguire.Su Windows 10 e Windows 11 non si dovranno insomma più gestire due applicazioni OneNote separate perché tutto risulta ora condensato in un'unica app.L'app OneNote aggiornata ha un layout simile alla versione classica ma presenta un aspetto completamente rinnovato per adattarsi a Windows 11. C'è ancora l'interfaccia a schede nella parte superiore della finestra per passare da uno strumento all'altro ma per chi è abituato alla visualizzazione più semplice di OneNote per Windows 11 è disponibile un pulsante che permette di passare a una barra multifunzione semplificata.A parte gli aspetti estetici, che hanno comunque la loro valenza, il nuovo OneNote si mette in evidenza per il supporto e il riconoscimento della scrittura ('ink').",
