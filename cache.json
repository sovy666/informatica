When I leave/close my laptop it goes to sleep and everything stays running, but when I attempt to wake up the screen (like with the use of a click of a mouse or key) nothing happens.

I tried adding the below to my /usr/share/sddm/scripts/Xsession\n nvidia-settings -a \"[gpu:0]/GPUFanControlState=1\" -a \"[fan:0]/GPUTargetFanSpeed=30\" -a \"[fan:1]/GPUTargetFanSpeed=30\" \n It doesn't seem to activate when SDDM starts. It seems like nvidia-settings doesn't run at all unless a user is logged in graphically. To confirm this, I logged in to tty2 after SDDM started and was sitting at the user login screen. I ran nvidia-settings and it failed, however after adding DISPLAY=:0, it failes with a different error about MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE missing.\n Both of those are kind of beside the problem though. If this was a headless server that wasn't running X, how would I go about using nvidia-settings to set the fanspeed?\n    submitted by    /u/bitwaba  \n [link]   [comments]",
