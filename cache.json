          "description": "I've tried installing arch ~5 times using archinstall and 2 times manually. I'm using an NVIDIA RTX3050 mobile so that's probably the culprit.\n Xorg logs don't show anything peculiar. Journalctl also shows completely normal logs. Using nvidia-xconfig does nothing. Deleting /etc/X11/xorg.conf does nothing. Deleting the entire /etc/X11/xorg.d/ does nothing. Following the wiki about using an NVIDIA card for everything without care of power does nothing. (did everything word for word as was suggested in the wiki 2 times with no luck).\n Anyway, doing startx freezes my laptop and the fans ramp up. I also tried just leaving it like that for an hour with no change. Only the poweroff button has any effect (shell complains that it doesn't understand the input). I still couldn't get any inputs in. For example, ctrl+alt+fx did nothing.\n I've installed arch ~10 times in virtual machines and different desktops and laptops. I've used arch for years and I've never seen anything like this. Google doesn't give any helpful results either. I tried every possible fix the first two google pages recommended. I've never dealt with NVIDIA cards so I believe this is something exclusive to them.\n Also, I'm using an Acer Nitro 5 with an RTX3050 and an 11th gen i5 CPU if that has anything to do with this issue.\n If anyone has a fix or could help me, please let me know. I would hate to install an inferior, glowing operating system to my laptop.\n    submitted by    /u/_Meisteri  \n [link]   [comments]",

I wanted to pair them with my Arch desktop, so that I could use LDAC to get the full capability out of these things.\n I've previously owned the WH-XB900N headphones, and those also support LDAC. Pipewire thankfully makes LDAC pretty easy, and I didn't have any issues with those.\n When I paired the headphones to my arch install, it ONLY shows the Headset HSP/HFP profiles. No High Fidelity audio options. The mic is on, and the headphones are stuck in headset mode.\n I've tried everything, and I cannot get it to go into an A2DP mode. I've unpaired and repaired them over and over, I've factory reset the headphones, updated pipewire, and tried to use the command line to force the audio profile. Nothing. \n I connected my WH-XB900Ns, and they immediately connected via LDAC, and showed a whole host of other codec options.\n Weirdly, when I put them into simultaneous device mode, where two devices can be connected at the same time (but also disables LDAC), it works, and I can use AAC to listen to audio.\n I tried pairing them to my Mac, and they connected via AAC just fine, without being in simultaneous device mode. The issue seems isolated to my arch install.\n Pulling my hair out over this, would appreciate any guidance.\n    submitted by    /u/please_respect_hats  \n [link]   [comments]",

Queste lacune di sicurezza hanno portato i ricercatori a intensificare gli studi sul funzionamento dei processori: negli anni seguenti sono infatti venute a galla molteplici vulnerabilit√† alle quali i produttori hardware e software hanno risposto in maniera differente.Sono state infatti realizzate patch che agiscono a livello di microcodice, kernel, driver, sistema operativo e persino lato applicativo per ridurre al minimo la superficie di attacco.In mancanza delle patch correttive, un aggressore che interagisce con i meccanismi di branch prediction della CPU o misura il tempo di esecuzione delle istruzioni in alcuni casi pu√≤ recuperare dati personali e informazioni riservate, comprese password e chiavi di decodifica.Per lungo tempo (e in parte ancora oggi) gli attacchi come Spectre, Meltdown cos√¨ come tutte le varianti successivamente emerse, sono stati considerati di grande interesse ma di scarsa valenza pratica.",

Con Windows 8.1, rilasciato a ottobre 2013, l'azienda di Redmond ha provato a porre rimedio a quei grossolani errori compiuti con Windows 8 circa un anno prima. Tra gli 'svarioni' pi√π madornali ricordiamo la decisione di accantonare il tradizionale menu Start per guardare a un menu a tutto schermo progettato in primis per i dispositivi dotati di display touch. Nel 2012 l'interfaccia touch non era matura e non c'erano abbastanza dispositivi in grado di supportarla cos√¨ la nuova impostazione introdotta con Windows 8 divent√≤ rapidamente invisa alla maggior parte degli utenti.Sebbene con Windows 8.1 Microsoft abbia compiuto un deciso passo indietro, il sistema operativo non ha mai conquistato il favore degli utenti che hanno preferito restare con Windows 7 e, successivamente, a partire dal 2015, valutare la migrazione a Windows 10. Proprio l'anno scorso abbiamo detto perch√© Windows 10 √® destinato a diventare il nuovo Windows 7.Windows 8.x non ha mai 'primeggiato' in termini di quote di mercato ma sui PC pi√π vecchi sono ancora un buon numero gli utenti che utilizzano Windows 8.1, sistema operativo verr√† ritirato da Microsoft il 10 gennaio 2023.",

Today's article is focused on the Linux performance of that flagship Core i7 1280P compared to other AMD and Intel laptop processors.",
