I just re-installed Arch after a few months on OpenSUSE and everything is (mostly) working, however, if I'm using Arch everything will freeze up and I can't find a way to un-freeze it within 10-20 minutes of booting (as long as I'm actually using the computer). \n I just got a new motherboard and power supply, and installed those & the rest of my old parts into a new case, so I initially thought that might've been the issue. However, I was having BSODs in Windows, too, except those all mentioned \"HYPERVISOR_ERROR\" and once I turned off AMD SVM those seem to have gone away... so I mean, that's still something I need to figure out but virtualization isn't a huge deal for me so I'll kick that can down the road for now. I tried to update the BIOS before turning off SVM, but that didn't stop the Windows BSODs or the Arch freezes.\n Anyways, disabling SVM hasn't helped Arch at all. The journals are all a bit different, but it seems like the freezes usually happen while I'm using Firefox. I'm pretty sure I installed all the drivers that I need, but I'm not positive. Here's a copy of sudo journalctl -b -1 after rebooting from a freeze: https://pastebin.com/CVCwvC4j.\n I'm using Gnome with an AMD 3700x and an Nvidia GTX 1080. Any advice would be super appreciated!

So I have lately installed arch about a dozen times and the same thing keeps happening to me, no matter if I change my PC, network, am in a VM or on real hardware. To my knowledge the arch iso updates the mirrors once. Everytime my download rate starts at 50mb/s which gets the job done really quickly, but over the course of 10-30s it goes down to just 100kb/s and stays at that rate. Which surprisingly only happens with Arch. Am I being throttled in some way or another and is there a way to fix this issue, as it makes the download take an hour or two instead of the 3 minutes it would usually take.

Nothing appears on the monitor until I get to the login prompt, so it skips right over the NUC splash screen and the screen that lets me select what disk to boot into. Very rarely if I turn on the monitor and the NUC at exactly the right times with respect to each other, I can see the disk selection screen for a brief moment. And if I press any keys to prevent the system from getting to the arch login prompt (e.g. F2/ F10/ <Down + enter> to enter the firmware options screen), then nothing at all appears on my screen at any point. It's not even a black screen - the monitor is telling me there is no input whatsoever (except, like I said, when the the login screen appears.)\n Occasionally I also see some of the logs for a moment before the login (the ones starting with [ok]\n ).\n My question: I want to be able to select a different disk to boot from (e.g. a. USB with arch.iso so I can reinstall arch) but I can't access the screen to do that.

Quell'era in cui il browser dell'azienda di Redmond poteva vantare quote di mercato che sembravano assolutamente inarrivabili, soprattutto per via del fatto che Internet Explorer era il browser predefinito integrato in Windows.Eppure Firefox prima e Google Chrome poi hanno fatto la storia superando Internet Explorer per quote di mercato. I browser concorrenti convinsero gli utenti laddove Internet Explorer stava fallendo: aderenza agli standard per il Web, prestazioni, supporto per le estensioni e possibilità di personalizzazione.Chrome nasce nel 2008 e con il passare degli anni è cresciuto rapidamente per diffusione tanto da diventare il browser più utilizzato in assoluto al mondo.Ne esistono versioni per Windows, macOS, Linux, Android e iOS: la pagina di download di Chrome permette di scaricare la versione più adatta al sistema in uso.",

Google Cloud, in collaborazione con TIM, ha annunciato l'avvio delle attività della prima cloud region italiana.Il termine cloud region viene comunemente utilizzato dai fornitori cloud e dagli utenti per identificare il data center attraverso il quale vengono erogati i servizi. In generale, quando si mettono delle applicazioni e dei servizi a disposizione degli utenti, i server dovrebbero essere fisicamente posizionati il più vicino possibile rispetto ai client collegati. In questo modo è possibile garantire prestazioni di primo livello massimizzando la banda disponibile e riducendo la latenza.Inoltre, utilizzare data center fisicamente posizionati entro i confini dell'Unione Europea consente di mettersi in regola con gli adempimenti previsti nel Regolamento generale sulla protezione dei dati (GDPR).La nuova cloud region inaugurata questa mattina a Milano (denominata europe-west8) è la prima delle due di Google Cloud che saranno utilizzate in italia.",

Tanto che i portavoce di Kioxia si spingono a sostenere che lo storage esterno XFMEXPRESS sarà una valida alternativa alle unità SSD.\n\nTra le caratteristiche di primo piano anche il fattore di forma: con dimensioni pari a 14 x 18 x 1,4 mm, la memoria esterna XFMEXPRESS presentata da Kioxia consente di non sacrificare spazio sui dispositivi che per loro natura già devono essere ultracompatti.",

L'obiettivo principale consiste nel sottrarre i codici OTP per superare l'autenticazione a due fattori e assumere il controllo degli altrui account.Il fatto è che molte applicazioni malevole riescono ancora oggi a infiltrarsi nel Google Play Store superando le verifiche automatizzate e violando le norme alle quali tutti gli sviluppatori dovrebbero attenersi (il download di componenti da server di terze parti è proibito).Come si legge nel report di Dr.",

Semplicemente includendolo come parte integrante dei suoi sistemi operativi, Microsoft riuscì a scalzare Netscape e consolidare un monopolio durato anni.Nel 2002 il browser Phoenix, poi diventato Firefox, lanciò la vera sfida a Internet Explorer cominciando a guadagnare importanti quote di mercato a danno del browser Microsoft con Opera che nel frattempo denunciò la società per abuso di posizione dominante.",
