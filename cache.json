I left a comment about 3 months ago with some simple package changes that would greatly improve the package.\n I left a second comment six weeks or so ago offering to take care of my proposed change and the update if the maintainer would add me as a maintainer.

Ever since Apple made their M1 chips Windows seems to have increased efforts to move to ARM, Ubuntu has a ARM variant as well etc. I know that Arch ARM exists but it isn't officially‍ supported. Considering the performance vs cost benefits of ARM based hardware, it appears to me that pretty soon x86_64 will become obsolete and will be replaced by ARM hardware. It will be quite very sad if I can't use my favourite Operating System, I imagine it will take quite some work to provide compatibility for ARM hardware. So are there plans to at least start work in the side for ARM compatibility ? What is the current state of such a project if it exists ?\n    submitted by    /u/Wonderful_Voice_9911  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello again!\n After I got my GPU drivers to work a few days ago, my PC has refused to output to more than one monitor at a time. I have a monitor-sized 1080p TV hooked up to an HDMI port, and an old Dell monitor plugged in to one of the DisplayPort sockets (cable is DVI on the monitor end)\n When the machine boots, the BIOS and GRUB appear on the Dell monitor. Once the driver and X load, it switches the Dell monitor off and displays on the TV (which is my primary display anyway). Opening ARandR, it only seems to detect the TV. Even unplugging the HDMI cable from the card, both while the PC is running and before boot, it never switches back to the Dell monitor. Only ever uses it during boot.\n Specs, in case you need them:\n AMD Ryzen 5 2600\n 16GB DDR4\n PowerColor Radeon RX 6600\n Gigabyte B450…",

They communicate over LAN (including encryption and authentication of course). It is very easy to set-up and doesn't contain unnecessary features in my opinion.\n Here are some links in case you are interested:\n  \nGitHub repositories (contributions are welcome!): \n Server\n App\n \n App Download \n Google Play\n F-Droid (don't wonder, the screenshots are broken there)\n \n Server is available on the AUR\n Basically everything you need to know including how to set it up and install everything\n  \nI really hope you like it!

Quali e quanti dispositivi la stanno utilizzando?Esistono svariati modi per scoprire chi è connesso alla rete WiFi o al router.\nCapire chi è collegato alla rete locale usando il router\n Tutti i router in commercio consentono di verificare quali dispositivi client sono connessi alla rete locale via WiFi o cavo Ethernet: basta effettuare il login al pannello di configurazione e fare riferimento alla sezione Dispositivi collegati (può avere un nome differente).Non tutti i router si comportano però allo stesso modo e le informazioni sui client collegati sono in alcuni casi farraginose e incomplete.\n\nUn ottimo lavoro lo fanno ad esempio i router ASUS ZenWiFi che restituiscono, ove disponibile, il nome di ciascun dispositivo collegato alla rete specificando per ciascuno di essi se sta usando la connessione cablata o la WiFi.",

Sebbene alcuni esperti consiglino di aspettare ancora qualche giorno prima di procedere con l'installazione delle patch di questo mese, la presenza di alcune vulnerabilità piuttosto pericolose suggerisce di 'giocare d'anticipo'.E neanche tanto d'anticipo visto che una delle falle di sicurezza più pericolose di questo mese, contraddistinta dall'identificativo CVE-2022-22047 è già utilizzata dai criminali informatici per condurre attacchi più o meno mirati.CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency), agenzia governativa statunitense che si occupa di contribuire alla riduzione delle minacce che possono causare problemi ad infrastrutture critiche utilizzate a livello nazionale, ha lanciato l'allerta proprio sulla vulnerabilità CVE-2022-22047 esortando gli enti pubblici ad aggiornare i rispettivi sistemi informatici entro e non oltre il 2 agosto prossimo.Pur non assegnando un punteggio particolarmente elevato in termini di gravità, Microsoft conferma che la falla CVE-2022-22047 può essere sfruttata per acquisire privilegi SYSTEM su qualunque sistema Windows vulnerabile (leggasi, ove non sia stata applicata la patch correttiva già disponibile).",

Le categorie di esercenti in possesso di partita IVA che negano il pagamento da parte del cliente mediante transazione elettronica sono quindi passibili di sanzione: 30 euro più una quota variabile pari al 4% del controvalore complessivo della spesa. Ovviamente sono escluse multe nel caso in cui la transazione elettronica non possa avvenire per 'oggettiva impossibilità tecnica'. Con il preciso obiettivo di contrastare il fenomeno dell'evasione fiscale il legislatore ha previsto l'obbligo di attrezzarsi al fine di gestire i pagamenti elettronici. Per i professionisti, i negozianti, gli artigiani e in generale per tanti esercenti, dotarsi di un POS per gestire i pagamenti elettronici veniva considerata una spesa superflua, comunque rimandabile, soprattutto per via delle commissioni elevate. \nCos'è Axerve POS Easy e come funziona\n Axerve POS Easy è una soluzione pratica ed economica che viene incontro alle specifiche esigenze proponendo soluzioni sia senza commissioni come Smart POS Easy a canone che a basse commissioni come Smart POS Easy a commissioni.\n\nEntrambe le offerte, prevedono un POS intelligente che si connette sia in 4G che tramite WiFi in modo da poterlo utilizzare in qualunque situazione, all'interno delle mura della propria attività come all'esterno, ad esempio quando si dovesse raggiungere l'utente per un servizio in loco.",
