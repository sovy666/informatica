Wanting to reformat as ext4 or XFS).\n  \nAnd i also have 2 active users on the PC, me and my wife.\n Is there a fancy way to have que Storage HDD mounted as, let's say /home/shared? with full read/write access to both users if i formated as ext4 or XFS?\n Nowadays, being NTFS both users has full access to all files inside. But if I reformated as XFS or ext4 won't permissions, user and group create conflicts between files from one user and another? I need both users to have full permissions on all disks contents.\n PS: Also, for storage like documents, music, videos, etc in that storage disk should i use XFS, ext4? or its the same any of them?\n    submitted by    /u/thalskarth_  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, i saw something about putting it in Maximum Performance mode. I believe this to be the fix.\n ​\n Issue:\n My issue is, going to nvidia-settings and putting it on Maximum Performance does not stick. As soon as i reboot, its back to auto.

I went with the .deb package because I saw more info online for it.\n I decided the easiest way to do all this was with AUR (Arch User Repository). And then using YAY (Yet Another Yogurt).

I've got both KDE 5.24 and GNOME 42 installed on my Arch system, largely because of GNOME's more mature Wayland implementation. All arch packages are up to date, systemd is version 251, and I'm using the latest ZEN kernel, 5.17.9.\n These DE's seem to play poorly together, with GNOME the more affected party. Perhaps notably, my login/startup is SDDM, not GDM, since I had installed KDE first.\n In both\n opening a terminal gives the message:\n discover_other_daemon: 1% \n which I think is the clue that things are duplicated.\n On GNOME: The KDE wallet system always opens at startup, and the akonadi server processes all run in the background. Further, the KDE demon runs in the background; if I log out or shutdown, it warns me that I will also log out... myself, but that's presumably my username \"logged in\" on a KDE session.\n Theming on GNOME seems to be seriously impacted, in that only my legacy app theme -- the one I can set in KDE, fwiw -- respected, whereas all other GTK apps, including all those that are part of GNOME itself, completely ignoring my theming, darkmode preferences, etc. Changing config files doesn't seem to do anything, nor does completely deleting them, even.\n Any Ideas about what to try? I think if I can find a way to make KDE services and daemons only launch if a KDE desktop session is started by me would probably solve all the troubles, though I don't know what troubles that might cause for KDE.\n    submitted by    /u/Watership_of_a_Down  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is fixed on Wayland but it seems like there is no way for me to adjust GPU fan speed. I think my GPU has a broken fan controller or something because it makes a grinding noise over and over when starting up and at certain speeds (no clue how hard this would be to fix). so I usually set the fans to a higher speed.\n I saw a post here with someone using green with envy in a separate/parallel TTY.
