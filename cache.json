I wanted to pair them with my Arch desktop, so that I could use LDAC to get the full capability out of these things.\n I've previously owned the WH-XB900N headphones, and those also support LDAC. Pipewire thankfully makes LDAC pretty easy, and I didn't have any issues with those.\n When I paired the headphones to my arch install, it ONLY shows the Headset HSP/HFP profiles. No High Fidelity audio options. The mic is on, and the headphones are stuck in headset mode.\n I've tried everything, and I cannot get it to go into an A2DP mode. I've unpaired and repaired them over and over, I've factory reset the headphones, updated pipewire, and tried to use the command line to force the audio profile. Nothing. \n I connected my WH-XB900Ns, and they immediately connected via LDAC, and showed a whole host of other codec options.\n Weirdly, when I put them into simultaneous device mode, where two devices can be connected at the same time (but also disables LDAC), it works, and I can use AAC to listen to audio.\n I tried pairing them to my Mac, and they connected via AAC just fine, without being in simultaneous device mode. The issue seems isolated to my arch install.\n Pulling my hair out over this, would appreciate any guidance.\n    submitted by    /u/please_respect_hats  \n [link]   [comments]",

Simple fix is to downgrade all of the associated packages and add them to PkgIgnore. Although I would like to learn what is the best practice when you notice that your common hardware is incompatible with common software.

          "description": "Dopo aver pubblicato a inizio dello scorso giugno l'anteprima pubblica di Windows Autopatch, un nuovo meccanismo per l'aggiornamento dei sistemi aziendali che prevede la gestione e l'applicazione automatica delle patch disponibili, Microsoft ha confermato la disponibilità generalizzata dello strumento.Con Windows Autopatch gli aggiornamenti non vengono più scaricati e installati con Windows Update perché tutto il processo è elaborato sul cloud da parte di Microsoft. Vengono comunque utilizzati alcuni dei componenti software alla base del funzionamento di Windows Update for Business per gestire gli aggiornamenti disponibili.Windows Autopatch non può essere utilizzato nell'ambito di domini locali Active Directory ma solo ed esclusivamente con Azure AD, anche in configurazione ibrida. Si rivolge quindi agli utenti in possesso di una licenza Windows 10/11 Enterprise E3 o superiore ed è gratuito.Il nuovo servizio Microsoft è in grado di gestire gli aggiornamenti qualitativi e delle funzionalità (i cosiddetti feature update) di Windows 10 e Windows 11 così come la distribuzione sulle singole macchine dei driver, firmware e delle applicazioni Microsoft 365.In un video pubblicato su YouTube Microsoft illustra i passaggi necessari per attivare Windows Autopatch: è necessario effettuare il login su Endpoint Manager come amministratore globale quindi cercare Windows Autopatch nel menu principale.Dopo aver configurato un tenant in Azure AD, Windows Autopatch suddivide automaticamente i dispositivi usati in azienda in quattro gruppi indicati da Microsoft come 'rings', 'anelli' in italiano.",
