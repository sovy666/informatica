It bugged out for a second, then immediate screen tearing.\n There were also weird pixel lines of different colors over the bottom half of the video when I hovered my cursor over it, but they went away when my cursor did. Most likely something to do with Brave alone.\n But now my entire system has screen tearing again.\n What could it be?

Avere a disposizione un accesso Internet ovunque ci si trovi è un'esigenza comune a molti.Per non farsi trovare impreparati e avere la possibilità di collegarsi sempre a Internet indipendentemente dalla propria posizione geografica di seguito proponiamo alcuni semplici consigli.\nCondivisione della connessione dati sul proprio smartphone\n Ormai tutti gli operatori di telefonia mobile consentono di condividere la connessione dati rendendola disponibile ad altri dispositivi. Attivando la funzione hotspot WiFi sul proprio smartphone è possibile accedere alla rete Internet usando la connessione dell'operatore di telecomunicazioni prescelto.L'importante è verificare innanzi tutto che la SIM preveda un piano dati con un buon numero di gigaby…",

VBA è un'implementazione di Visual Basic che è stata progettata negli anni '80 e che viene inserita all'interno di applicazioni Microsoft come appunto la suite Office.Dal momento che il codice VBA permette di eseguire un ampio ventaglio di operazioni sul sistema in uso, le macro sono da tempo sfruttate come trampolino di lancio per la diffusione di molteplici tipologie di minacce informatiche.Quando si riceve un documento via email o lo si scarica da Internet questo viene aperto in Office nella modalità chiamata Visualizzazione protetta: il caricamento delle macro eventualmente presenti viene automaticamente disabilitato e il file è gestito in sola lettura.",

          "description": "BackBlaze è una nota azienda che offre servizi cloud e che utilizza, nei suoi data center, anche hard disk e SSD consumer in grande quantità. La ratio è utilizzare dispositivi per la memorizzazione dei dati che sono poco costosi rispetto a soluzioni di storage enterprise ma che all'atto pratico si sono dimostrati affidabili sul lungo periodo, anche nella gestione di workload caratteristici di un data center.L'azienda statunitense pubblica periodicamente i dati relativi agli hard disk con il minor numero di guasti e di recente ha esteso le misurazioni rivelando i nomi delle unità SSD più affidabili.In un articolo da poco apparso sul blog ufficiale di BackBlaze l'azienda ha voluto utilizzare un approccio diverso e ha esaminato i suoi dati per stabilire quanto può durare un hard disk.Per farlo ha utilizzato lo stimatore di Kaplan-Meier, utile in vari campi applicativi per valutare i cicli di vita e stimare la sopravvivenza di organismi viventi e componenti di macchinari.Utilizzando i dati sul comportamento degli hard disk raccolti da BackBlaze dal 2013 ad oggi, i tecnici della società hanno potuto produrre delle curve che approssimano il ciclo di vita stimato per specifici modelli di hard disk o per categorie di essi.BackBlaze ha messo a confronto i risultati ottenuti per gli hard disk da 4, 8, 12 e 14 TB.Nel caso dei modelli meno capienti da 4 TB, prendendo in considerazione due modelli di hard disk HGST e Seagate, BackBlaze ha concluso che con i dischi fissi HGST è lecito attendersi che essi continuino a funzionare senza problemi a distanza di almeno 6 anni dal primo utilizzo nel 97% dei casi.",

Tra gli aspetti maggiormente degni di nota vi sono il menu delle impostazioni ridisegnato e il tema dinamico Material You.Kevin Barry, ideatore di Nova Launcher, ha confermato che la sua 'creatura' - insieme con Sesame Search, un'applicazione che funge da motore di ricerca universale e che è capace di creare dei collegamenti verso le risorse che si usano di più - è stata acquisita da Branch Metrics.Branch Metrics è una società che offre strumenti di analytics che è largamente conosciuta soprattutto dagli sviluppatori.Branch dispone di un enorme database con oltre 300 miliardi di deep link nelle app e fornisce agli sviluppatori una piattaforma per gestire e misurare questi collegamenti.",

          "description": "Con l'avvento dei computer quantistici alcuni problemi che fino ad oggi si ritenevano praticamente irrisolvibili, spesso perché richiedono uno sforzo computazionale che va ben oltre le capacità di calcolo odierne, potranno essere finalmente gestiti.Il rovescio della medaglia è che i computer quantistici renderanno obsoleti gli attuali algoritmi crittografici.Un algoritmo crittografico è sufficientemente sicuro se, escludendo vulnerabilità intrinseche, offre un'adeguata protezione contro attacchi basati sulla tecnica del bruce forcing e rispetto alla fattorizzazione.Prendendo in esame il caso di RSA (sono le iniziali degli inventori Rivest, Shamir e Adleman) che lo misero a punto nel lontano 1977) abbiamo visto quanto è davvero sicuro un algoritmo crittografico.Stando ai risultati di uno studio elaborato da Craig Gidney e Martin Ekerå nel 2019 e rivisto nel 2021 ci vorrebbero 20 milioni di qubit, l'unità di informazione quantistica, per completare con successo la fattorizzazione di una chiave RSA-2048 in 8 ore.Gli attuali computer quantistici più performanti (e 'ingombranti') non superano i 130 qubit: si capisce immediatamente quanto lavoro ci sia da fare.Il NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) ha però ricordato che è bene agire per tempo: per questo motivo ha avviato un programma di ricerca dei migliori nuovi algoritmi per la crittografia post-quantum.L'obiettivo è individuare algoritmi che siano resistenti ad attacchi portati avanti con i futuri e sempre più performanti computer quantistici.Ecco quindi che l'agenzia federale statunitense ha svelato i primi sei vincitori di una 'gara' durata 6 anni.'Il nostro programma di crittografia post-quantistica ha fatto leva sulle migliori menti della crittografia - in tutto il mondo - per produrre questo primo gruppo di algoritmi resistenti ad attacchi quantistici.",
