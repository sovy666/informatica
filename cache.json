          "description": "I have a ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9 with an encrypted LUKS2 root partition with FIDO2 authentication. It is a dual boot setup with Windows 11, where systemd will chainload an EFIstub.\n I want to protect against Evil Maid attacks and want to sign systemd-boot and my EFIstub with keys that will then be enrolled in Secure Boot.\n The best way to do this seems to be to use /u/Foxboron's sbctl utility, but I'm worried about doing so because ThinkPad X1 Carbon models have had a propensity to brick when secure boot keys have been enrolled improperly: https://old.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/epadb5/psa_dont_install_custom_secure_boot_keys_on_x1/\n I'm not sure if the issue has been fixed between Gen7 and Gen9, but my Gen9 does require OpRom in the boot chain. I'm not sure what the right steps to take to properly enroll self signing in UEFI with such hardware is.\n Could anyone confirm they've successfully done this process on an X1 Carbon Gen 9 using sbctl and that has not resulted in a brick of the laptop? If so, could you point me to some steps on how to do that?\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/trashcan86  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here I decided to shut the system down to install two other SSD's I used for storing games on my old rig. \n Powered everything up, grub was fine, and the error I mentioned earlier shows up during the journal recovery screen before KDE loads.\n So far, with my TTY, I have tried reinstalling KDE and trying various methods of getting a gui session, like Ctrl+Alt+F7, and systemctl commands to start/restart kde's services.\n I have tried the loginctl command, which only returns my current TTY session, or any others that happen to be open.\n I should mention that I used the archinstall script during installation, but I can't imagine that would affect anything.

          "description": "Hi everyone. I've recently hopped over to arch (gnome), and I've been having problems with my CPU temperatures. Before this, I was using Manjaro, and everything worked fine. Now, when idling the cpu sits at 50-60*C and when doing heavy tasks it gets up to 100*C. My fans are fine, this is a recently purchased Acer Swift 3, so what I'm guessing is the problem is that the OS isn't communicating with some hardware. I've ran sensors-detect, and tried controlling my fan speed that way, but it comes back with \"There are no pwm capable fans in your system', which may be the problem. (Side note: After installing arch and installing some packages, my maximum RAM went down from ~16.4 to 15.2, the same as I had on Manjaro, even though when I play some games with memory leaks the ram usage will rise above that number. Probably unrelated, but thought I should share.) Anyways, if you need more info let me know, all help appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/Key_Squirre1  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "It almost seems like the Xorg session is related or something? This system just started doing this consistently yesterday but its done it in the past with an older install of arch but it was rare and reboot resolved it so I never figured out the why.\n basically the audio wont work at all for anything in anyway and video playback in web-browser, specifically youtube and twitch wont really play. I can scrub a youtube video and video play back window will update with an image of whats in the video at that point I stopped in the time line but it wont play said video. Twitch will update one frame every like 30 seconds but thats it. this issue is persistent in both firefox and google chrome. I can play an mkv or local video via VLC just fine (though still no audio). Audio is set to the right output, wont work if I send it to the onboard audio out or bluetooth.\n if i log out of my DE (KDE plasma xorg) and sign into (KDE) wayland, it all works fine, audio plays, video will render and play. I'd love to just ditch xorg and go to wayland but wayland seems to have its own issues, primarily games wont render a framerate higher than my displays refresh rate and I've not been able to find any info on solving that issue so I've been sticking to Xorg but this issue is worse so im at a bit of a loss on how to fix it.\n this happened yesterday, a reboot didnt solve the issue. I nuked the nvidia drivers, rebooted, reinstalled the nvidia drivers and that seemed to have fixed it so I thought that was that but the issue has returned today and im not quite sure where the junction is cuz I thought video rendering and audio issues were normally entirely separate so idk whats up.\n any one have any idea or point me in a useful direction?\n ​\n system:\n  \narch 5.17.5\n plasma 5.24.4\n Ryzen 5 3600x\n 16gb ddr4 ram\n nvidia 1080 w/ 510.60.02 drivers\n  \n   submitted by    /u/TONKAHANAH  \n [link]   [comments]",

For some reason, after booting my custom kernel (which should be the same as the one Arch Linux provides), it feels more responsive, but I have no easy way to verify it, other than going back to the arch kernel and running similar benchmarks\n My question is, is there performance or other benefits in building your own kernel ? and is there an easy way to compare the responsiveness of the kernels?\n    submitted by    /u/-Luciddream-  \n [link]   [comments]",
