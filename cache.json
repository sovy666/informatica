          "description": "recently, I started messing around with Arch Linux and was able to get it running dual-booted with Windows 11, running GRUB as the bootloader.\n After doing this, I've been fine for pretty much a week with no issues only thing I've been doing was downloading packages for my setup. Today was really weird, though.\n first Qtile started not responding to my hotkey inputs, so then I decided to start fresh with a new config and reload. Once I did that, everything was working fine and while watching a youtube video, it just ended up glitching out. (The last second was repeating non-stop like a skipping CD and the whole interface froze. I couldn't move my mouse, quit out of qtile, or use any inputs to get back to the shell)...\n After that horrifying experience, I went ahead and shut down the system manually by holding the power button.\n the situation that I'm in now, is that my PC won't even POST. I've let it sit for a while (2 hours), thinking that might help, but once I hit the power button again, it just hangs. Nothing comes up on the screen, just black. The monitor can't even pick up anything from my PC it just says, \"no signal detected\". What's even weirder is that I can't even manually turn off my PC, the power button is completely useless, and the only thing I can do is shut it off from the back.\n Does anyone have an idea of what's happening/happened? Did I fry my internals? Or am I still able to come back from this?\n Any insight would greatly be appreciated. I kind of need my PC for other stuff too 🥲.\n ​\n [Edit]: Popped out one of the ram sticks and the system started up again like nothing happened.\n    submitted by    /u/12jikan  \n [link]   [comments]",

I just re-installed Arch after a few months on OpenSUSE and everything is (mostly) working, however, if I'm using Arch everything will freeze up and I can't find a way to un-freeze it within 10-20 minutes of booting (as long as I'm actually using the computer). \n I just got a new motherboard and power supply, and installed those & the rest of my old parts into a new case, so I initially thought that might've been the issue. However, I was having BSODs in Windows, too, except those all mentioned \"HYPERVISOR_ERROR\" and once I turned off AMD SVM those seem to have gone away... so I mean, that's still something I need to figure out but virtualization isn't a huge deal for me so I'll kick that can down the road for now. I tried to update the BIOS before turning off SVM, but that didn't stop the Windows BSODs or the Arch freezes.\n Anyways, disabling SVM hasn't helped Arch at all. The journals are all a bit different, but it seems like the freezes usually happen while I'm using Firefox. I'm pretty sure I installed all the drivers that I need, but I'm not positive. Here's a copy of sudo journalctl -b -1 after rebooting from a freeze: https://pastebin.com/CVCwvC4j.\n I'm using Gnome with an AMD 3700x and an Nvidia GTX 1080. Any advice would be super appreciated!

Tuttavia, non tutte le implementazioni della rete mobile di quinta generazione sono uguali: con il termine 5G Standalone (5G SA) viene fatto riferimento a una rete capace di autosostenersi senza dipendere da nessun'altra tecnologia sottostante.Le reti 5G SA assicurano molteplici benefici in termini di prestazioni in downstream e in upstream (compresa la riduzione della latenza), copertura, riduzione dei consumi energetici e sicurezza. Inoltre consentono l'utilizzo di caratteristiche evolute come il networking slicing ovvero un meccanismo che abilita un'efficace gestione e ripartizione delle risorse disponibili tra i clienti mobili garantendo la capacità di ogni singolo collegamento di rete.Di recente avevamo parlato di Dynamic End-user Boost, una soluzione che proprio Ericsson ha presentato per consentire agli utenti di migliorare la connessione proprio quando ne hanno più bisogno.Le network slice, spiegano Ericsson e TIM, sono porzioni di rete logiche virtuali che supportano diversi casi applicativi con caratteristiche e requisiti particolari.",

          "description": "Il fondatore di Telegram, Pavel Durov, non ha peli sulla lingua. Tante volte ha criticato la concorrenza Facebook-WhatsApp osservando tra l'altro come l'app di messaggistica più usata al mondo sia completamente chiusa e anzi le attività di reverse engineering siano rese difficoltose con un diffuso offuscamento del codice.Viceversa Telegram è open source e permette di creare versioni riproducibili partendo dal codice sorgente.Va detto però che il sorgente è effettivamente aperto soltanto per quanto riguarda la parte client mentre il funzionamento del sistema lato server resta segreto.Questa volta Durov se la prende con Apple accusando platealmente la società di Cupertino di costringere gli utenti iOS a utilizzare le versioni native delle applicazioni che vengono pubblicate nell'App Store.Secondo la tesi del fondatore di Telegram, la Mela ostacolerebbe l'utilizzo delle applicazioni Web attraverso il browser evitando di abbracciare standard che sono ormai universalmente accettati e utilizzati.Apple non permette agli sviluppatori di browser l'utilizzo di motori di rendering alternativi rispetto a WebKit: su iOS, quindi, tutti i software per navigare sul Web sono costretti a utilizzare il motore WebKit, incluso Firefox che su tutte le altre piattaforme ha sempre utilizzato il sistema di rendering delle pagine chiamato Gecko prima e Quantum poi.Durov racconta che Telegram stesso risente delle limitazioni imposte da Apple: le regole imposte dall'azienda guidata da Tim Cook non consentono a Telegram, ad esempio, di supportare i canali pubblici senza restrizioni.",

I tecnici di Redmond hanno infatti inserito nel pacchetto Visual Studio tutto il necessario per lavorare con un ecosistema hardware aperto.Risultano inclusi strumenti come .NET 6, .NET Framework, WSL, WSA, Windows Terminal, C++, Java, Python, Node JS , Git e molti altri già ampiamente familiari per la stragrande maggioranza dei programmatori.Con il nuovo Visual Studio 2022 per ARM64 è quindi possibile realizzare applicazioni desktop in C++ (progetti basati su MSBuild), .NET (WinForms e WPF) capaci di sfruttare sia .NET Framework che la versione più aggiornata e moderna di .NET e app per il Web.Per installare Visual Studio 2022 su un dispositivo ARM64 basato su Windows 11 basta fare riferimento alla pagina di download: verrà scaricato il file d'installazione compatibile con l'hardware in uso.Il nuovo IDE contribuirà a ridurre significativamente la dipendenza dall'emulazione x64 sui dispositivi ARM.",

I browser concorrenti convinsero gli utenti laddove Internet Explorer stava fallendo: aderenza agli standard per il Web, prestazioni, supporto per le estensioni e possibilità di personalizzazione.Chrome nasce nel 2008 e con il passare degli anni è cresciuto rapidamente per diffusione tanto da diventare il browser più utilizzato in assoluto al mondo.Ne esistono versioni per Windows, macOS, Linux, Android e iOS: la pagina di download di Chrome permette di scaricare la versione più adatta al sistema in uso.",

In questo modo è possibile garantire prestazioni di primo livello massimizzando la banda disponibile e riducendo la latenza.Inoltre, utilizzare data center fisicamente posizionati entro i confini dell'Unione Europea consente di mettersi in regola con gli adempimenti previsti nel Regolamento generale sulla protezione dei dati (GDPR).La nuova cloud region inaugurata questa mattina a Milano (denominata europe-west8) è la prima delle due di Google Cloud che saranno utilizzate in italia.",
