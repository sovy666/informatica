          "description": "Hey guys,\n So recently I've decided to create an interesting project: Use FreeBSD as a guest with my dGPU via GPU Passthrough. But it's got a lot of caveats to it and I wonder if someone could help me.\n The first reason why I'm not installing straight into my machine is because it's a Surface Book (1st Gen - Performance Base Edition) which doesn't even recognize the keyboard after trying to install it via an external one. So it has to have a Linux kernel and run it as a guest.\n The second problem is that despite running almost perfectly, the laptop requires a custom kernel called surface-linux in order to have stable WiFi connection and recognize the NVIDIA dGPU.\n Following along, the third problem was switching between the iGPU and the dGPU. In that case, I've opted for the optimus-manager project in order to switch between them. It's works great with Arch.\n So the only way I could run FreeBSD with the NVIDIA dGPU would be by using a Type 1 Hypervisor such as KVM. That would be the only way to get the GPU Passthrough.\n I've read ArchWiki article regarding GPU Passthrough extensively. I was able to isolate the NVIDIA dGPU, by loading only the vfio-pci drivers when turning on, but I'm still not able to connect with the VM using it.\n One thing to notice is that when using lspci the NVIDIA dGPU appear as 3D Graphics, and not VGA. I'm pretty sure this is the reason why I cannot fully detach it.\n Can anyone help me with this project?\n    submitted by    /u/toasty_fe  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello Friends.\n I launched the curated user repository a few weeks ago and now comes the package manager to go with it.\n AUR packages are reviewed and whitelisted. Additional package recipes are directly shipped with the curated repo.\n So far it works really well. But it is brand-new - so please bear with me, if something goes wrong. Please file a github issue, if you encounter a bug.\n Right now, the basic feature set is implemented. You can use it to install and remove packages. Additional features are planned in the future. Please give it a try and let me know in the comments, if there is something you wish to have.\n Also... Feel free to file a github pull request, if there is a package you'd like to have included.\n I created a helper script, that makes it very easy to add additional packages to the AUR whitelist. If you want to bump a package version, simply re-run the script with the package name and it will update to the latest version:\n  $ aur-whitelist build2 # whitelist build2 4424cce8e2f4d87fa54b1b53a354dec7d784e8f9 build2 $ aur-whitelist build2 # already up-to-date already accepted, skipping: build2 \n -- flydude\n P.S.: Some of you might wonder, if this qualifies as an AUR helper. Not really, I'd say. We do include high-quality packages from the AUR. But the packages are reviewed and maintained inside a single git repo. Therefore it's more like Gentoo Portage (hence the name).\n    submitted by    /u/flying-dude  \n [link]   [comments]",

The issue that I am facing is that with the router in front of me, I am getting around 60% Signal Strength and if I go to the next room, the signal strength drops to around 25% and my WiFi Gets disconnected. This does not happen with other devices / laptops. The network that i am trying to connect is operating on the 5Ghz band.\n I also went and installed the Latest driver from Intel's Website Intel WiFi Driver Link (https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/drivers/iwlwifi) and copied this under /lib/firmware but it made no change to my Signal Drop issue. I also tried the latest Linux kernel. It did not solve my issue. This did not happen with Ubuntu 20.04 which I was running earlier.

          "description": "Edit: The kernel documentation on uinput says it's for \"emulating input devices from userspace\", and the examples there are also for sending inputs, so I don't think this can be used to record inputs. From what I've seen you'd need access to the files in the /dev/input/ folder for that, which is limited to root or those in the input group on my system. I'm not an expert though, so take that with a grain of salt.\n So when I was trying out ydotool (essentially xdotool except it also works on Wayland) I noticed that it did not ask for root privileges at all and worked just fine, and my user is not even in the input group as the AUR package says is required.\n After digging deeper I noticed that I have read-write access to /dev/uinput (which is the file ydotool needs access to, and is why it usually won't just work), and it turns out it's because of a udev rule installed by the Steam package as part of /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/70-steam-input.rules, specifically this one:\n ```\n Steam Controller udev write access\n KERNEL==\"uinput\", SUBSYSTEM==\"misc\", OPTIONS+=\"static_node=uinput\", TAG+=\"uaccess\", OPTIONS+=\"static_node=uinput\" ```\n The Steam Controller known issues page does say that it's needed for the gamepad emulation mode.\n So, essentially if you have Steam installed even if you're on Wayland any app can mess with mouse and keyboard inputs, just like in X11. Is this supposed to be common knowledge? I didn't see it mentioned in the Arch Wiki page for Steam.\n On the bright side, I guess it means that the complaint about Wayland breaking the input automation use case is kind of moot with things like this lol.\n    submitted by    /u/X_m7  \n [link]   [comments]",

I normally use Required to prevent MITM attacks, but the database key rings are no longer working so I have temporarily disabled the need for them. What is the security risk for allowing unsigned databases in comparison to packages? I think I'm still secure as the execution of an unsigned package is what I would assume allows for MITM attacks but I just want to double check about other potential security risks. The only problem I could think of is someone perhaps imitating the database and giving me a malicious package with a proper package signature, but I'm not certain if that is feasible or if I should be concerned about other security risks.\n ​\n Thank you for your time\n    submitted by    /u/Dear_Situation856  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey all! I am running whoogle-git from the AUR right now, and I have it's systemd service enabled on boot. When I do this, my boot time is lengthened by quite a bit. Here is the output of systemd-analyze critical-chain whoogle.service\n https://i.imgur.com/bsQVPCz.png\n As you can see, the service is \"critical\" and thus it needs to finish launching before continuing in the boot process. You can also see that the systemd-networkd-wait-online.service is taking 16 seconds, probably because it's waiting for the whoogle service.\n I am not sure exactly what I should be googling for a result but if any of you guys could help me to make the service not halt the boot of my computer, it would be greatly appreciated! Maybe I could also give this solution to the creator of the AUR packages.\n    submitted by    /u/Fxzzi  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I tecnici di Amazon hanno annunciato di essere al lavoro su un nuovo progetto basato sull'intellligenza artificiale che in futuro andrà ad arricchire le abilità di Alexa.L'assistente digitale Alexa sarà infatti in grado di emulare qualunque voce e parlare con il timbro di un proprio caro o di un personaggio famoso.Secondo Amazon basta sottoporre ad Alexa un breve spezzone del parlato (circa un minuto; la voce può essere anche registrata) perché l'assistente digitale sia in grado di esprimersi usando 'parole sue', mai ascoltate in precedenza, ma adoperando le caratteristiche vocali di un qualunque individuo.La bizzarra rivelazione è stata resa durante la conferenza annuale re:Mars di Amazon: Rohit Prasad, vicepresidente senior della società e responsabile del progetto Alexa, ha descritto in dettaglio una serie di nuove funzionalità in arrivo. Il momento più toccante è stato senza dubbio quando l'assistente Alexa ha letto una storia a un bambino prima di andare a dormire usando la voce della nonna defunta.È bastato usare un solo minuto di audio registrato della donna perché Alexa creasse un'impronta vocale da usare per qualunque tipo di interazione.'Il modo in cui abbiamo potuto realizzare tutto questo è stato inquadrare il problema come un'attività di conversione vocale e non come un percorso di generazione del parlato', ha fatto presente Prasad.Amazon non ha lasciato intendere quando la nuova caratteristica potrebbe debuttare in Alexa.C'è da dire che sarà importante verificare quali limitazioni Amazon deciderà di imporre su una funzione del genere che, ovviamente, potrebbe essere utilizzata anche per scopi tutt'altro che legittimi ovvero nell'ambito dei furti d'identità.Abbiamo detto in passato che l'impronta vocale non può essere considerato come uno strumento biometrico utile ad autenticare gli utenti.Google stessa, con lo strumento VoiceMatch, fa sì che il suo assistente digitale si attivi e restituisca informazioni soltanto quando viene riconosciuta una voce nota.",

          "description": "Uno dei problemi che gli utenti lamentano più comunemente è la comparsa dell'errore Boot device not found all'avvio del PC. Il messaggio di solito appare su una schermata a sfondo nero e può presentarsi nelle varianti No boot device found, No boot device available e simili.Il messaggio d'errore certifica il fatto che il sistema non è riuscito a trovare un'unità di memorizzazione avviabile. Questo può succedere perché l'hard disk o l'unità SSD risultano danneggiati, perché i file di avvio sono corrotti, perché non è collegata alcuna unità avviabile, per via di impostazioni non corrette a livello di BIOS.Per risolvere l'errore Boot device not found e similari è bene andare per gradi.\nBoot device not found: verificare se l'unità è riconosciuta e la sequenza di avvio\n Il primo passaggio da compiere per superare l'errore Boot device not found e ripristinare l'avvio di Windows consiste nell'accedere al BIOS quindi portarsi nella sezione Boot options per verificare, innanzitutto, che l'hard disk o l'unità SSD contenente Windows sia correttamente riconosciuta.In caso affermativo è fondamentale verificare l'impostazione Boot sequence o Boot order: come prima unità deve essere selezionata quella che contiene Windows.Dopo aver effettuato un'eventuale variazione sulla configurazione del BIOS, è necessario salvare le modifiche (Exit saving changes) e lasciare che la macchina si riavvii automaticamente.Come ha confermato anche lo sviluppatore di VeraCrypt può capitare che l'installazione di un aggiornamento di Windows porti alla modifica indesiderata della sequenza di boot.",

Copre il 100% della gamma colore DCI-P3, è protetto con un vetro Corning Gorilla Glass 3 e ha un rapporto d'aspetto pari a 16:10 con frequenza di refresh di 60 Hz.\n\nBasato su chip Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2 (un octa-core con grafica Adreno 680 realizzato a 7 nm), Xiaomi Book S abbina 8 GB di memoria RAM e 256 GB di storage interno: è presente uno slot per l'inserimento di schede SD che consente di estendere ulteriormente le capacità di memorizzazione.Il comparto fotografico è composto da una fotocamera posteriore da 13 Megapixel e una fotocamera frontale da 5 Megapixel.Parlando di connettività, Xiaomi Book S integra il supporto WiFi 5 (802.11 ac), Bluetooth 5.1, include una porta USB 3 Type-C (il caricabatterie assicura una ricarica rapida a 65W) ed è presente il jack cuffia da 3,5 mm.Il dispositivo accoglie inoltre due speaker stereo e un doppio microfono.Per il tablet/2-in-1 Xiaomi vengono offerti due accessori opzionali: una custodia con tastiera fisica integrata che si collega con un attacco magnetico (ha un touchpad che trasforma il tablet in un piccolo notebook) e la Smart Pen, una penna digitale che rileva 4.096 livelli di pressione e campiona a 240 Hz.La tastiera opzionale è full size con tasti larghi che migliorano la digitazione (sono alti 1,5 mm).\n\nPresentato in un video ufficiale da poco condiviso su YouTube, Xiaomi Book S viene presentato al prezzo di 700 euro.",

          "description": "Storicamente Facebook ha messo a disposizione degli utenti che si servono di dispositivi mobili due applicazioni: una permette di consultare il social network e gestire le pagine, l'altra è un client di messaggistica istantanea.Il client di messaggistica si chiama Messenger e quando si naviga all'interno del social network da browser Web su desktop, notebook, tablet e convertibili risulta integrato nell'interfaccia di Facebook. Basta cliccare sull'icona raffigurante un fumetto con all'interno il simbolo di un fulmine per accedere alla schermata a comparsa Chat.\n\nSui dispositivi mobili, invece, le app Facebook e Messenger sono separate: ciascuna di esse occupa almeno 50-65 MB di spazio e ha una diversa occupazione in termini di memoria RAM.Installando l'app Facebook e toccando l'icona di Messenger nella barra in alto, l'applicazione invita l'utente a caricare sul dispositivo mobile anche Messenger.\n\nHa senso tenere due applicazioni simultaneamente in esecuzione sullo smartphone quando potrebbero essere integrate in una sola app? Secondo noi, no.\nCome usare Facebook con Messenger\n Fortunatamente esiste un semplice trucco per usare Facebook con Messenger integrati in un'unica app.Gli utenti possessori di un dispositivo Android possono infatti installare e usare Facebook Lite: si tratta di una versione più compatta del client Facebook che integra anche la messaggistica di Messenger (sarebbe dovuta arrivare anche su iOS ma ad oggi non è ancora accaduto).Pur essendo molto più leggera rispetto alle app citate in precedenza Facebook Lite offre sia la possibilità di usare Facebook che Messenger.",
