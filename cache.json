The main ones being that some of my apps won't display properly; such as Steam, when i go to launch steam via the cinnamon menu, it starts a fully black box where the steam window should be. Thus, I can only start steam in the terminal to actually see/use it - strange since it references the same command. I also am unable to change some of the themes (namely the icon theme or the mouse pointer theme). I have tried a few things now, but it's just really getting on my nerves. I'm assuming that if I can just wipe cinnamon off and re-install it fresh, I'm hoping it will just resolve all the problems I've got. I'm not sure what impact or problems I might create doing this on my main PC, so I wanted to ask advice on how to best do this without making myself more headaches afterwards. I tried just removing it via the usual command below, but after I re-install cinnamon, it simply restored my previous settings/problems (I'm assuming it keeps the config files, maybe do I need Rsc? I am a little worried on running the -c option if so).\n $sudo pacman -Rns cinnamon $sudo pacman -S cinnamon \n FYI I start my PC, and launch X via typing $ startx, and my xinitrc file simply just has the exec set to the below.

Based on my past experience, these two desktop environments should not conflict.\n My issue is that setting a GTK theme in Cinnamon does not seem to affect Gnome applications with CSD, even those which are not on libadwaita (for example Gnome Disks or evince).\n Setting an environment variable like GTK_THEME=Mint-Y-Dark-Aqua in /etc/environment fixes this, but then the libadwaita apps (like Gnome Software) have their stylesheets completely f*cked up. They seem to then use a legacy Adwaita theme with the graphics on various lists and switches being extremely glitched.\n I don't understand this behaviour. I expected that libadwaita or maybe even gtk4 apps in general to resist theming, but not the usual gtk3 apps with CSD. The same apps also don't get properly themed even if the \"legacy\" theme is set in Gnome, rather than Cinnamon. Eg. in the screenshot the gtk theme is set to a Mint theme, but both the tweaks and disks app clearly uses the old Adwaita stylesheet.\n What's the reason for this and how to fix it?\n EDIT: For some reason, setting the GTK theme to adw-gtk3 (the gtk3 theme mimicking the look of the new libadwaita apps does work; but for example the Mint-Y themes don't, as the screenshot shows)\n    submitted by    /u/Ulrich_de_Vries  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I installed Archlinux last year, and it was a disaster from the start because I was struggling to understand some of the basic concepts. I took time to finally read about the things that were causing me trouble, such as Grub, Sudo, networking and some other random issue.\n FF today, and I was feeling like an imposter on Arch. I began asking myself if I could swim. So I decided, hey; let's try installing to a VM without diving into man or info files except maybe for a reference, and stick with only the Arch User Install guide. Granted, I still need to do some system maintenance.\n I cautiously booted the April Installer in VirtualBox via UEFI mode, and got nervous that maybe it wouldn't work because of vbox issues in the past. I had to choose the EFI image, and then to test, I attempted the archinstall script. This failed when installing packages. I felt defeated for a brief moment, and then remembered that was only to see how it would work. No big deal.\n I then began to follow the Install Guide,which I myself, and many in the Arch community recommend. The time was set, the partitions were made, the system was pacstrapped and it all seemed to go much easier than I recall. Could this work from the first go, I questioned myself? Something must have been done incorrectly, this is not going to work. Having installed LXQt, I ran systemctl enable sddm and hoped for the best.\n Aha, I was greeted with the login screen, and no user listed. I had forgotten a simple useradd So, I switched to tty2 and made the user and rebooted. I then proceeded to boot into my freshly installed Archlinux vm and was presented with the LXQt desktop Environment. There are still many things to do for house cleaning, but this felt like success.\n Don't give up.\n edited for spelling.\n    submitted by    /u/RandomXUsr  \n [link]   [comments]",

Most of the posts I have encountered center around installing on a system with one small root SSD and one bigger home one which does not apply to me. The second SSD can be easily formatted and mounted to be used as a storage space for files but then the package manager does not install packages there when home partition gets full.\n What I planned to do was that one SSD would have boot, swap, root ,home as usual while the other SSD also being included in /home so that it is utilized by the package manager. I don't exactly know if this is possible. In any case, can anyone point me into the right direction to look at to figure it out?\n TL;DR my main goal is that I want my OS to use both drives to install packages, both home partition of the 1st drive and the whole of 2nd drive, kinda like treating it as one.\n    submitted by    /u/LopsidedExperience30  \n [link]   [comments]",

It was a while ago when I was trying to fix this issue and I forgot everything that I tried. I tried searching ArchWiki and forums and noting helped me. I did however discover that when you are updating your system, that your boot partition needs to be mounted and if you unmount it it should be empty. If I unmount my partition it's not empty (stat initramfs-linux.img shows file was indeed copied there at last update).\n When I try to boot I get:\n  \n[FAILED] failed to start Load Kernel modules.[FAILED] failed to mount /boot/EFI[DEPEND] Dependency failed for Local File System\n  \nThen I get emergency shell.\n journalctl -xb mentions:\n  \n/boot/EFI: unknown filesystem type 'vfat'\n  \ncat /etc/fstab\n  \nUUID=ZE69-C2EC /boot/EFI vfat rw,realtime, .... , errors=remount-ro 0 2\n  \nuname -a\n  \n5.16.10-arch1-1 ...\n  \npacman -Q\n  \n5.17.1.arch1-1\n  \nLast time I updated I gave up trying to fix it because only kernel downgrade worked. Today I tried to update it again since I hoped it would be fixed by update, like the first time, but that didn't happen.\n I'm also using LVM on Luks if this is important.\n Does anyone have any ideas what else I can try or where else can I look for solution? Anyway thanks for reading.\n    submitted by    /u/IdeaForNameNotFound  \n [link]   [comments]",
