È possibile concentrarsi ad esempio sui documenti e sui file personali oppure (o in aggiunta) creare backup dell'intero sistema o, ancora, impostare backup bare metal che effettuano una copia del sistema operativo sistema operativo e di tutti i dati tranne i dati utente nei volumi critici.Come il predecessore, anche Windows 11 integra uno strumento per eseguire il backup del sistema: si chiama wbAdmin ed è parte integrante della dotazione offerta da Microsoft.\nBackup Windows 11 con wbAdmin\n Esistono molteplici soluzioni di disk imaging che permettono di creare una copia di backup dell'intero contenuto del sistema o di singole partizioni.",

          "description": "Ci troviamo nel periodo durante il quale ARM è solita annunciare le novità che debutteranno da qui a un anno sotto forma di prodotti commerciali.La società britannica, che ha visto sfumare l'acquisizione da parte di NVidia e che adesso è nel mirino di una cordata di imprese capeggiata da Qualcomm, ha annunciato la nuova generazione di CPU ARMv9 basate su core Cortex-X3 e Cortex-A715. ARM ha anche annunciato un Cortex-A510 'rinnovato'.\n\nPartendo dalla proposta più performante, il Cortex-X3 è un core focalizzato sulle prestazioni (+22% rispetto agli smartphone Android di punta basati su Cortex-X2). Secondo ARM i SoC basati su Cortex-X3 sarebbero fino al 34% più prestazionali rispetto ad esempio a un Intel Core i7 per notebook (28W).ARM fa riferimento anche a un aumento del valore IPC pari all'11% rispetto al Cortex-X2 che utilizza lo stesso processo produttivo.Non si parlato esplicitamente, in questo caso, di migliorie in fatto di efficienza energetica: l'azienda si è limitata a dire che Cortex-X3 consuma meno energia nella maggior parte dei casi rispetto al Cortex-X2.Il secondo nuovo core, Cortex-A715, raccoglie l'eredità del Cortex-A710: sarà il core 'a media potenza' in questi SoC che usano un'architettura composta da tre cluster fornendo un buon equilibrio tra potenza ed efficienza.",

Tante app sono in inglese e chi non è abituato a leggere spesso testi in questa o in altre lingue può realizzare di essere un po’ arrugginito per quello che riguarda la traduzione in italiano.Per tradurre testi nelle app Android, di seguito proponiamo tre possibili soluzioni: le prime due si basano sull'utilizzo di applicazioni sviluppate da Google, la terza fa leva su un'applicazione di terze parti davvero utile e semplice da usare.\nAndroid: tradurre testi in italiano con Google Traduttore\n L'app gratuita Google Traduttore si è da tempo arricchita di una comoda funzionalità chiamata Tocca per tradurre: essa consente di visualizzare una piccola 'bolla' sopra le altre app e di tradurre in italiano i testi presenti in qualunque app che ne consenta la selezione.Per utilizzare lo strumento basta installare il traduttore Google, fare clic sull'icona in alto a destra, scegliere Impostazioni quindi Tocca per tradurre.\n\nA questo punto si devono attivare le opzioni Tocca per tradurre e Mostra icona floating.\n\nL'icona di Google Translate compare sullo schermo: a questo punto si può aprire l'app Android di proprio interesse quindi selezionare il testo e scegliere Copia.\n\nToccando la 'bolla' del traduttore Google, si può incollare il testo copiato dall'app Android e ottenere immediatamente la traduzione in italiano.\n\nUna volta conclusa l'operazione di traduzione, la 'bolla' di Google Translate può essere disattivata dall'area delle notifiche di Android.L'unico problema, nel caso della soluzione basata su Google Translate, è che l'app Android deve consentire la selezione del testo da tradurre.\nTradurre testi dagli screenshot delle app con Google Lens\n Una soluzione alternativa per ottenere la traduzione in italiano di un testo scritto in un'altra lingua consiste nel creare uno screenshot del contenuto dell'app Android: di solito è possibile farlo premendo Volume giù+tasto accensione.",

          "description": "Un tempo imparare i rudimenti della programmazione era quasi indispensabile. Per sfruttare il potenziale di un elaboratore informatico e adattarne il funzionamento alle proprie necessità era necessario scrivere codice.Come racconta Steve Wozniak, cofondatore di un tempo, i sistemi di maggior successo di una volta erano così attraenti perché sollecitavano subito l'interesse dell'utente che era portato a sviluppare i suoi programmi con la possibilità di comunicare direttamente con l'hardware.Oggi sono disponibili strumenti e servizi che vengono incontro ad ogni possibile esigenza: essi solevano gli utenti dalla necessità di scrivere codice. Esistono anche nuovi strumenti basati sull'intelligenza artificiale che permettono di generare codice funzionante nei vari linguaggi di programmazione scrivendo semplicemente il nome di una funzione o descrivendo ciò che si vuole ottenere: GitHub Copilot e Amazon CodeWhisperer.Non c'è nulla di male: questi strumenti aiutano a concludere più velocemente lo sviluppo di un progetto dispensando il programmatore dallo scrivere codice di base o comunque che si ripete di frequente nei vari progetti.Sviluppare è un'attività stimolante che richiede una dose di logica e di creatività.",
