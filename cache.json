Here's what I did so far according to the wiki.\n Installed intel-media-driver, libva-intel-driver and lib32-libva-intel-driver, libvdpau-va-gl, libva-vdpau-driver.\n I verified that the following VA-API codecs can be decoded: MPEG2, H264, VC1, VP8, HEVC, VP9 and the following can be encoded: MPEG2, H264, VP8, HEVC using libva-utils.\n And even though the CPU should be able to decode VP9 vdpauinfo is only showing H264 decoder capabilities. But I also realized that the i915 driver is loaded and not the iHD one (according to inxi -G).\n But journalctl | grep \"iHD\" shows the following:\n  \nMay 23 13:32:19 laptop plasmashell[16880]: libva info: User environment variable requested driver 'iHD'May 23 13:32:19 laptop plasmashell[16880]: libva info: Trying to open /usr/lib/dri/iHD_drv_video.so\n  \nI also tried configuring VA-API by setting the LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME environment variable to iHD in my .bashrc but it still loads i915. Or did I maybe misunderstood this?\n I tried setting VDPAU_DRIVER=va_gl which also appeared to do nothing.\n In Firefox I configured the following according to the wiki:\n  \nCompositing is using WebRender.\n Set gfx.webrender.all to true.\n Set media.ffmpeg.vaapi.enabled to true.\n Set media.rdd-ffmpeg.enabled to true (default).\n Set media.ffvpx.enabled to false.\n Set media.navigator.mediadatadecoder_vpx_enabled to true.\n Set media.rdd-vpx.enabled to false.\n  \nDespite doing all this, intel_gpu_top is showing no load on Video.\n Should I only install intel-media-driver or libva-intel-driver? Or is it okay to have both installed and let the system choose the correct driver?\n Is it intended behavior that inxi is showing the i915 driver being used?\n Am I missing anything for Firefox 100.0.2 that's maybe not in the wiki?\n    submitted by    /u/Arjab  \n [link]   [comments]",

The other one is Digital Output (S/PDIF) HD USB Audio --- Digital Stereo (IC958) Output. Both of these have sound. I'm wondering which is the correct choice to get the best possible sound from my DAC.\n I've done some searches and there's been some conflicting information. Some accepted solutions say that picking Digital Output bypasses the laptop's built-in DAC and sends the digital signal to the external DAC directly without any processing, but I'm not sure if that's correct. I've read the Pipewire FAQ (https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire/-/wikis/FAQ#what-are-those-analog-stereo-and-digital-stereo-iec958-profile) but it's not much help, or maybe I just don't get it since I'm new to Linux audio.\n Tl;dr: which of these two is the \"correct\" and better sounding option for a DAC connected through USB: Analog Output or Digital Output?

          "description": "Chi ha vissuto l'informatica negli anni '90 certamente si ricorderà degli storici processori Mendocino di Intel immessi sul mercato nel 1998. Erano CPU Celeron che risultavano interessanti per le buone opportunità offerte agli appassionati di overclocking.Adesso anche AMD sceglie il nome Mendocino (si ispira a quello di una contea californiana, negli Stati Uniti) e lo fa per le sue nuove APU destinate ai notebook più efficienti ed economici. La conferma arriva all'apertura dei battenti del Computex 2022 di Taipei.I nuovi AMD Ryzen Mendocino sembrano piuttosto simili all'APU personalizzata Aerith che la società di Sunnyvale ha sviluppato per la console portatile Steam Deck di Valve.Mendocino includerà CPU, GPU e controller di memoria nello stesso pacchetto e sarà prodotta da TSMC su un moderno processo produttivo a 6 nm.AMD ha scelto in questo caso di utilizzare l'architettura Zen 2 e non la più aggiornata Zen 3 per motivi di costi e consumi proponendo modelli con 4 core fisici e 8 thread.Punto nodale è sicuramente la sezione grafica: AMD l'ha migliorata rispetto alle precedenti APU con grafica integrata basata su architettura RDNA2.Mendocino supporterà inoltre memorie LPDDR5 nelle configurazioni con bus di memoria a due (64 bit) o ​​quattro canali (128 bit).Il resto delle sue funzionalità di I/O, connettività e ottimizzazione dell'alimentazione sono le stesse utilizzate nella serie Ryzen 6000.\n\nIn termini di durata della batteria, AMD assicura che i computer basati su chip Mendocino potranno essere utilizzati per almeno 10 ore prima di necessitare di una ricarica.I primi sistemi basati su Ryzen Mendocino arriveranno sul mercato prima di Natale e si sa già che a utilizzarli saranno ad esempio i laptop Lenovo IdeaPad 1.I portatili equipaggiati con le APU Mendocino di AMD costeranno tra 399 e 699 euro e supporteranno sia Windows che Chrome OS.\nProcessori desktop AMD Ryzen 7000 e socket AM5\n Al Computex 2022 ampio spazio è stato riservato per la gamma di processori desktop AMD Ryzen 7000.",
