          "description": "Background\n I have an SSH server set up at home, and I expose it publicly on a non-standard port.\n Only two users are allowed access - \"main\" and \"share\". The \"main\" user is restricted to being accessed from 192.168.x.x addresses and is accessed solely by a key, and the \"share\" user can be accessed publicly with a strong password but is limited to folder access intended for sharing files with my family (achieved using \"ChrootDirectory\", \"X11Forwarding\", \"AllowTcpForwarding\", \"PermitTTY\", \"PermitTunnel\" and \"ForceCommand\").\n Additionally, I have fail2ban which blocks an IP after 5 failed attempts.\n The SSH server side of things is working as intended.\n Problem\n I guess the non-standard port isn't enough of a way to hide the server, as my fail2ban jail is filling up quite a bit, from what I can see using \"journalctl -u sshd\" there are daily access attempts from random IPs (which are successfully blocked).\n The problem however is that running \"journalctl -u sshd\" will typically only show about the last day's worth of logs, and show the warning \"Journal file /var/log/journal/[long ID]/user-[ID]@[another long ID].journal is truncated, ignoring file.\" Ideally I'd like to view the whole thing.\n I've looked at https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd/Journal and also tried Googling around, but I can find an obvious cause/solution. A lot of places mention \"/var/log/auth.log\" but this doesn't seem to exist on my Arch instance.\n Do you know what may be causing this?\n Thanks for any advice at all!\n    submitted by    /u/AlwynEvokedHippest  \n [link]   [comments]",
