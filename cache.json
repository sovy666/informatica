          "description": "Hi /r/archlinux. I discovered a simple but really great helper package today that I never saw mentioned anywhere, and thought I'd share: makepkg-meta.\n It allows you to easily create and update meta packages, i.e. packages whose sole job it is to pull in other dependencies. My use case is cleaner management of optional dependencies. \n With those, the question is always whether you install them --asdeps or --asexplicit. In the former case, they may get removed accidentally, in the latter case I often forget to remove them when uninstalling the depending package, so they just clutter the system (\"Hmm, do I still need that? Better leave it alone.\").\n Instead, create a meta package that depends on the package and all your chosen optional dependencies.\n E.g. to install zim with optional gnuplot and xdot, run\n makepkg-meta zim-meta -a zim -a gnuplot -a xdot \n which will create and install (*) a meta package zim-meta with the specified dependencies. All packages will be kept installed as long as it's there, and if you run pacman -Rsc zim, it gets removed automatically, taking the optional deps with it if needed.\n Adding more dependencies later can be done by a similar call (-a -> add). To remove a dependency, use\n makepkg-meta zim-meta -r xdot \n This will update the meta package, making xdot obsolete. Then, uninstall it via pacman -Rsc xdot or even\n pacman -Qdttq | sudo pacman -Rsc - \n to remove all orphan packages (since they're all really obsolete now that you know this trick).\n (*): AUR packages need to be installed (--asdeps) first, the tool uses pacman internally, so it can't resolve them. Or patch the script to use your AUR helper of choice.\n    submitted by    /u/axaxaxasmloe  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm assuming there's some kernel module I've forgotten to load or something.\n I can see the fan speed with nvidia-smi, and set the speed with nvidia-settings, but they don't show up in lm-sensors.\n My end goal is to get the fans added to my plasma-systemmonitor layout, but the only sensors that show up as options to add to my graph are ones found with lm-sensors. And I can't figure out how to make a custom sensor for plasma-systemmonitor that can be imported into the list of available sensors - If I could, I could just make a simple script to pull fanspeed with nvidia-settings every second.\n Any idea how to get the GPU fan sensors to show up?\n    submitted by    /u/bitwaba  \n [link]   [comments]",

Lo studio in questione dal titolo Your Echos are Heard è consultabile a questo indirizzo.Sia la società di Jeff Bezos che ben 41 partner pubblicitari utilizzerebbero i dati raccolti dai dispositivi Amazon Echo per creare profili degli utenti e servire annunci 'ad hoc'. Gli autori della ricerca osservano che questo tipo di dati è molto richiesto tanto che gli inserzionisti sono indotti a versare importi fino a 30 volte più elevati rispetto alla media.I 10 ricercatori che hanno elaborato il resoconto spiegano che vi è 'una forte evidenza che le interazioni con gli speaker intelligenti di Amazon siano utilizzate per il targeting degli annunci e che ciò implica una significativa condivisione dei dati tra più parti'.Amazon conferma di usare i dati vocali derivanti dalle interazioni con l'assistente digitale Alexa per esporre messaggi in linea con gli interessi e le aspettative di ogni singolo utente.",

A spiegarlo ci hanno pensato i tecnici di TSMC, azienda taiwanese che realizza i SoC per conto di Apple.Gli ingegneri di TSMC chiariscono che UltraFusion è un'interconnessione diretta tra chip chiamata InFO (Integrated Fan-Out) in gergo tecnico. Nell'elettronica digitale il fan-out rappresenta il numero di porte logiche che possono essere collegate all'uscita di una porta logica.Nel caso del SoC M1 Ultra TSMC ha utilizzato la tecnica InFO_LI (InFO con interconnessione locale) e un Redistribution Layer (RDL).",

Perhaps you are doing some research and you don’t want to risk the videos you are using as reference becoming unavailable. Maybe you want to keep all the videos in one place so that you can go through them all without searching or waiting. \n    \nIn another scenario, for example, you uploaded a video to a streaming site and no longer have the original but would like to recover it. If you have it saved offline, at least you can have a backup of it. Perhaps you are going away somewhere remote with no Wi-Fi for a month. You can line up a bunch of videos to keep you entertained.
