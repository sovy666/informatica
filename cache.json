I typically run gminer in the background all the time while I am using my system, and this doesn't cause any noticeable impact on Windows.\n I have been trying some different distros, and with PopOS and Fedora using proprietary nvidia drivers for my 3080Ti, I have the same experience where I can mine in the background and it doesn't appear to have any impact on the user experience.\n When I use anything Arch based though and install the nvidia DKMS drivers, I am getting very bad graphical lag when trying to use and move around windows while running gminer, to the point where the system isn't really useable.\n Some additional info: I am using GNOME in all the linux variations I have been testing, and I have enabled the full composition pipeline in nvidia settings on arch, but that didn't seem to make a difference. I have also tried with both normal Linux kernel and Zen kernel. I have tried archcraft, endeavour, manjaro, and xero for arch distributions to see if it was some weird distro specific thing, but I'm having the same issue on all of them.\n Any reason I would only be seeing the poor performance on Arch-based systems, and is there any way to optimize?\n    submitted by    /u/failf0rward  \n [link]   [comments]",

This file cannot be updated as another application has this file open at the same time'. \n Checking fuser on the files in question show that they are used by 'MusicBee.exe' and 'wineserver', probably meaning that wineserver is what's causing musicbee to lock up on making these edits.

Uninstalling apps is easy enough: simply go to the Apps list, find the app, and hit the Uninstall button. But it’s not so easy to completely uninstall apps on Android.\n    \nUnfortunately, for those who like a clean file system, some apps will leave behind “orphaned files” after uninstallation on Android devices. These files were created by the app so that it can do its job if they weren’t properly deleted after the app was uninstalled. This can get annoying when your device’s system is slowly clogged up by files and folders that aren’t being used. The solution then is to find a way to reliably remove leftover app data.\n   \n\nContent\n\nManual Clean\nDeleting Folders\nConnect to a Computer\nSD Maid\nES File Explorer\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n.toc{background-color:#f3f4f6;font-size:16px;font-weight:500;padding:1em;}.toc h4{text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase;font-size:0.9375rem;margin-bottom:1rem;}.toc ul{margin:0;padding:0;font-size:15px;}.toc-content{overflow-y:auto;max-height:600px;}.toc-content li{list-style:none!important;margin-bottom:1em;}.toc-content a{color:rgba(74,85,104,var(--text-opacity));text-decoration:none;}.toc-content a:hover{color:#C72F29;}.toc-content li.active a{color:#C72F29;font-weight:bold;}@media (min-width:1340px){.toc-wrap{position:absolute;float:left;margin-left:-9rem;top:0;left:-90px;height:100%;width:200px;background-color:white;}.toc{position:sticky;top:50px;font-size:14px;padding:0.5em;}.toc-content li{margin-bottom:0.5em;}}   \nAlso read:Read more",
