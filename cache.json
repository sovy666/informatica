As I already had this kind of situations, I disabled Bluetooth, turned it back on and reconnected the headset. But this time, upon reconnecting, I had no sound coming out from it.\n The only sound I am able to hear are the notification sounds from GNOME. That's it.\n I tested a BT speaker, a wired headset and even the internal speakers wouldn't work at all, which is very annoying because I use this laptop mostly for entertainment.\n I started running some tests : \n The laptop speakers do work properly. I tested under Windows 10 (the laptop dual boots) and the speakers and BT speakers do work properly.\n I tried to make it forget the headset that had the crash and pairing it back to no avail.\n speaker-test (from alsa-utils) didn't work so I guess there's the issue ?\n EasyEffects seem to detect audio from apps (I tested with Firefox, Audacious and VLC) but no sound waves are displayed, indicating that the issue must be before PipeWire in the audio software stack. In the case of Audacious, it's internal sound wave display works, indicating that audio is being decoded by the app.\n No, the sound was not muted and the correct output was chosen in the settings. That's the first things I've checked.\n I'm pretty sure the issue lies within ALSA but how can it be persistent after reboot if it was a crash ? Is there a way to put it back to default settings ?\n I'm running pretty much the same audio software stack on my main desktop and I regularly use BT speakers with it and I hadn't encountered this issue (it runs on KDE but that shouldn't affect audio as far as I'm aware of).\n    submitted by    /u/lululock  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have been looking for a way to make it so that pacman installs in my main LVM partition, but have found that nothing on the wiki that says I can even do that. So with this in mind, my question is this: Is there a way to change where pacman installs so that it's not in my root partition or will I have to reinstall and give my root partition more space keeping in mind the packages I want to install?\n ​\n I have done my best to RTFM for pacman and the closest thing I have found is a reddit post suggesting it would be possible to change the pacman package installation directory. This would be to create a hook which I am assuming means if it hits this directory redirect it to another one.

I’ve seen the ‘General Recommendations’ page on the wiki, but am not sure if that’s something that is optional. Am I good to just start installing apps, or do I need to do some additional configuration first, such as securing my system?\n \nIs there any way I could backup my system? Considering how new I am to this I know I’m probably going to break something eventually, and would rather not have to start from scratch each time. On a VM I know I could just take snapshots, but I am not sure how to do something like that outside a VM.\n \nOn installing AUR packages, I’ve read that I am supposed to manually check the package build (?). Is this what I’m supposed to be checking? If so, what should I be looking for yo make sure it is safe.\n \n Thanks!\n Edit: Added another question\n    submitted by    /u/FreeBeachFortune  \n [link]   [comments]",
