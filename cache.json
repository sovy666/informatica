I'm still happy with Debian but I got gifted an old laptop and wanted to try something different on it. Also I had trouble getting android studio and flutter to work on Debian (although others seem to have no problem) and I thought it would be nice to have a Linux system that could run newer programs and systems without issue. \n I've been loyal to Debian because I love the stability, being able to sit down to a system that just always works and not having to do too much maintenance. Which is probably not good for switching Arch, but I figured why not, since so many seem to enjoy it.
