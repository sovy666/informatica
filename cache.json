          "description": "Hi all,\n I am running Arch on a Thinkpad P50 with DWM as my window manager. I'm experiencing a problem with waking the computer from lid-closed sleep, where the computer wakes but the screen is black, except for a small horizontal line at the topmost left corner of the screen. The keyboard won't respond in this state, so I can't get another terminal open to diagnose or kill the display manager. \n Arch is otherwise running perfectly on the P50, but this issue is really annoying and I would love to resolve it. The problem is that I don't know where to start, and would really appreciate some guidance / tips from the community. I perused the forums and reddit, and couldn't find a post with the same issue - but I am sure that this is not unique to me. I'm running 5.18.13-arch1-1. No display manager is used; just a call to exec dwm in .xinitrc. \n I can provide whatever logging info would be helpful. I have the same build running on a Thinkpad X220, and that installation is bullet proof - so I wonder if it has to do with the hybrid graphics setup on the P50? I have the following graphics drivers installed: mesa, lib32-mesa, nvidia.\n Thanks again.\n    submitted by    /u/Away_Inflation_411  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n I've been using a set of bluetooth headphones for the last several months. A2DP has always worked great for listening to music and videos but obviously I needed to switch to HFP in order for the microphone to work. I'm using pulseaudio and was able to enable the HFP profile pretty painlessly with pavcontrol.\n This was fine until a couple of weeks ago, now my system is showing unavailable in `pactl list`:\n Profiles: a2dp_sink: High Fidelity Playback (A2DP Sink) (sinks: 1, sources: 0, priority: 40, available: yes) handsfree_head_unit: Handsfree Head Unit (HFP) (sinks: 1, sources: 1, priority: 30, available: no) off: Off (sinks: 0, sources: 0, priority: 0, available: yes) \n I followed the steps in the wiki relating to HFP issues. But I'm at a bit of a dead end. I tried running:\n dbus-send --print-reply --system --dest=org.ofono /phonesim org.ofono.Modem.SetProperty string:\"Powered\" variant:boolean:true \n With the error\n Error org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.UnknownObject: Method \"SetProperty\" with signature \"sv\" on interface \"org.ofono.Modem\" doesn't exist \n So I checked to make sure I have activated the modem, but downloading the git repo for ofono and running test/list-modems just creates a draggable text area on my screen for some reason, then exits out.\n I then went and checked the python code and ran the first couple of lines:\n import dbus bus = dbus.SystemBus() manager = dbus.Interface(bus.get_object('org.ofono', '/'),'org.ofono.Manager') modems = manager.GetModems() print(modems) >>> dbus.Array([], signature=dbus.Signature('(oa{sv})')) \n So looks like modems is empty and I'm not sure where to go from here?\n Any help much appreciated.\n Also curious why the headset is only recently not working, have had no similar issues on my phone.\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/jzia93  \n [link]   [comments]",

Most DE's and Linux installs already have the vanilla English version of it, however, I also type in Spanish and French, so I'd like to have a (preferably GUI) program to remap some of the keys in order to have the special characters unique to those languages. I already did some research and apparently xbindkeys is that sort of program but I can't seem to get it to work, has anyone else had this problem? Anyhow, I'm also looking for alternatives to tackle this problem. Thanks in advance!\n Note: before switching to Linux, I had this problem sorted on Windows 10 with a program called Keytweak, it let me remap keys to my liking, this would be the kind of thing I'm looking for. There was also a Windows layout creator that was very useful.\n Extra question: is there a way to bind ctrl+delete to delete the entire word on Arch/KDE plasma.\n    submitted by    /u/basedand-sarahpilled  \n [link]   [comments]",
