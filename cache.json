I'm not intimidated at all by the Arch installation process because it's literally just a set of instructions. \n What I am concerned with is maintaining the machine. By that, I mean the following:\n  \nWhen I want to download something for \"Linux,\" Ubuntu is always listed at the top. It's very easy. I sudo apt install or whatever else, and boom, I've got the program up and running. Is it equally easy to get software on Arch? Is there any branch of software at all (gaming, etc.) that will be even mildly annoying to get compared to Ubuntu?\n Will drivers work out of the gate or is that something that will need to be setup manually? I can list my specs if necessary, but that seems a bit presumptuous of me. The short version is: can I expect that if my machine/peripherals all run on Ubuntu, that they'll run on Arch?\n Is maintaining/updating my system easy? I straight up don't have to think about it on Ubuntu. I hit apt update, then sudo apt upgrade and I'm good to go.\n  \nBasically: the following scenario:\n I want to grab Lutris. Then I want to install League of Legends. After that, I want to get Rust setup. Then get Nitrogen for my wallpapers. Get Discord. Then, after leaving my computer up for a week like an idiot, I want to completely update my system (drivers, apps, git, whatever). Any chances for drivers/apps to brick because the latest update isn't good?\n Is any part of that more complicated than Ubuntu?\n Is there any part of the daily driving experience that will be more annoying on Arch or is everything post-installation streamlined and easy?\n    submitted by    /u/directedgraphs  \n [link]   [comments]",

I also want to try how touchscreen stuff works on Gnome.\n I started by reading a bit about what to do as the X1 Fold (with a weird CPU, OLED touchscreen no physical mouse or keyboard...) is a bit exotic. This may have caused a few issues in Ubuntu 22.04, like no backlight control, i915 not being able to claim the display in lshw -C video...\n Still, it's such a cool device I still want to try to make it work on Linux.\n I've tried a lot of different kernel cmdline flags. They helped a bit for various things, but while waiting for my custom kernel to compile I've decided a best use of my time would be to try returning to Arch to do things the right way from the start!\n I found this post from libcg (account now deleted) which is very interesting given my i915 problems: https://web.archive.org/web/20160714232204/https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/4cojj9/it_is_probably_time_to_ditch_xf86videointel/\n In practice, on a new install for a 10th gen Ice Lake, would you chose to use modesetting over Intel driver?
