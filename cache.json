          "description": "Almost a year ago I acquired a thinkpad p1 gen 3 from my employer, and of course immediately wiped Windows in favor of Arch with GNOME. As with every install, I wanted to play with what was new in the linux world so I set up my user account using systemd-homed as a BTRFS subvolume (not an encrypted luks loopback). For the most part this has worked out ok. \n Recently, I wanted to set up the fingerprint reader so I installed and enabled fprint. Theoretically this is supposed to enable the fingerprint enrollement UI inside GNOME settings without further configuration. It did not. I was able to register a print with fprint-enroll and the effects are:\n  \nfprint-verify works\n GDM prompts that I can use fingerprint to log in, but attempting to do so always fails\n The GNOME lock screen also prompts that I can use fingerprint to unlock, and that works fairly reliably (the sensor itself seems finicky, which squares with what ive read of others' experience with thinkpad fingerprint readers)\n systemd-ask-password prompts (such as when running a systemctl command without sudo, which display via GNOME UI) do not offer fingerprint authentication, nor does it work if i try to press the sensor anyway\n GNOME settings still shows nothing in relation to fingerprint auth in the user management section \n  \nI've searched around a bit and I haven't been able to find anything about this issue from other users, so I'm hoping someone around here has some experience with this odd combination of fingerprint auth, GNOME and systemd-homed that can provide some insight.\n Fail that, it's quite difficult to figure out where exactly to open an issue with upstream GNOME or what chat channels are available to work through debugging so maybe some pointers there would be helpful.\n tl;dr fprint + systemd-homed doesn't seem to be picked up by GNOME authentication prompts consistently. Unsure where to seek help.\n    submitted by    /u/EpocSquadron  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello r/archlinux!\n I hope all of you are well. \n I've recently encountered an issue on one of my machines. It seems that QT apps are using a different emoji set compared to GTK+ apps. I find this a little bit odd because I use the exact same fontconfig on all of my machines (copied across machines both in /etc and ~/.config) and I don't have the issue on the other machines at all.\n Here's a screenshot of what I am talking about: Screenshot\n Left (GTK) = xfce4-terminal & xed\n Right (QT) = qterminal (my terminal of choice) & kate\n It seems that QT apps are using the older Noto \"blob\" style emoji rather than the current Noto ones (which are applied system-wide except for qt apps). \n I have been searching for a solution for the past 2 hours, reviewing the Fonts section on the Arch wiki and conducting several web searches, to no avail. \n I'm hoping that I could be guided to the right direction on this one. I assume it's a package involving plasma/qt5 that installs an embedded emoji blobs font, but I can't seem to find the package or figure that out yet (also, I could be wrong).\n Why are emojis a concern?: I am currently working on a minimal website with emojis and I am using some emojis from the latest unicode (u14). My editors of choice are Kate and Vim running on qterminal. Unfortunately with my preferences, having the older emoji blobs on qt applications means most of the new emojis (even from 3-4 years back) are not displayed on the screen. \n Any help would be sincerely appreciated.\n Thank you very much.\n    submitted by    /u/blista_kanjo604  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, I am sure that I can help myself with your knowhow.\n _________________________________________________________________\n Background:\n When I assembled my first PC 4 years ago, I had no experience at all with PCs, let alone with building them. My colleagues helped me assemble the PC and set up practically everything for me. Among the installed parts was a wireless network card which I connected to my Gigabyte Z370 HD3 mainboard.\n Since the beginning, however, I had a problem, namely that my PC always started up by itself after I had shut it down. After quite a bit of trial and error, I found out that it was the network card which caused the problem.\n I sold it and stayed without wifi and bluetooth for a few years until I recently bought a new network card (Gigabyte GC-WBAX210) and behold, the same problem occurs again.\n ___________________________________________________________________\n Troubleshooting:\n At first I thought of wake on lan or better said wake on wireless lan but all settings in the BIOS and in the network manager are disabled. I have also tried several interfaces on my mainboard but without success. As with the previous model, the card is connected via a PCIEx1 interface and an internal USB 2 cable. After extensive reading of the wiki and other posts, I am unfortunately still at the same point.\n ____________________________________________________________________\n Request:\n I would therefore like to ask you if you know of any ways of dealing with this problem in arch.\n ____________________________________________________________________\n Info dump:\n lshw\n ifconfig\n lsusb\n lspci\n    submitted by    /u/AfGandalfistan  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Quando ci si accinge a cambiare router o comunque ad acquistarne uno nuovo, sono tante le specifiche tecniche sulle quali bisogna soffermarsi.Le sigle che appaiono nel nome del modello del router gi√† offrono preziose indicazioni sulla tipologia di dispositivo.- BE, AX, AC, N. Sigle di questo tipo presenti nel nome del router stanno a significare lo standard supportato dal dispositivo.Nei router pi√π recenti compare la sigla AX a indicare che il prodotto supporta lo standard WiFi 6 (802.11 ax)Sulla carta WiFi 6 consente di raggiungere velocit√† di trasferimento dati fino a 9,6 Gbps anche se all'atto pratico √® estremamente difficile avvicinarsi a questo valore. Molto dipende anche dai dispositivi WiFi collegati: se non sono compatibili WiFi 6 e se non possono i canali pi√π ampi le prestazioni massime risulteranno molto pi√π ridotte: ne parliamo nel dettaglio nell'articolo che abbiamo citato poco sopra.La sigla AC fa riferimento al supporto per lo standard WiFi 5 (WiFi 5) che sulla carta non permette di superare i 6,9 Gbps in condizioni ottimali.La sigla N indica i router pi√π vecchi che supportano solo WiFi 4 (802.11 n) e che sono contraddistinti da prestazioni complessivamente pi√π mediocri.Tutti i router AX, AC e N possono lavorare sulle frequenze dei 2,4 GHz e dei 5 GHz.L'indicazione BE non √® ancora utilizzata e sar√† parte integrante del nome del modello di tutti quei router compatibili WiFi 7.- WiFi 6E.",

Since benchmarking the AMD EPYC 7773X with its hefty 1.5GB of L3 cache for 2P servers via AMD 3D V-Cache, I've been curious to try this forthcoming kernel on that Milan-X configuration. Here are such benchmarks looking at the AMD EPYC 7773X 2P performance on Ubuntu 22.04 with its default Linux 5.15 kernel against Linux 5.17 stable and then the 5.18 development kernel.",
