          "description": "I always seem to forget what I need to add to my Arch install if I want to use a dark theming. For instance, on my current setup (after a recent Arch re-install) I have some programs that are BLINDING white!\n I just installed KDE Plasma and Cinnamon and I sort of have everything that I need but I didn't want to have to install those 2 DEs just to get the theming I want. Some things are looking better after the 2 DE installs (File manager is dark themed after going through the Look and Feel application and choosing the theming I want) but things like LibreOffice is still blinding me.\n I know some applications require different theming protocols in order to get things looking the way I want them to look.\n EDIT: Now LibreOffice has a dark mode in it's Options settings so I've fixed that. I'm going to play around a bit and see if anything opens and stabs me in the eyes with bright white still. :)\n If anyone knows the packages I need to install to make these changes on initial install/startup, I'd greatly appreciate it. I can add that to my script of software to install for new Arch installs.\n    submitted by    /u/Phydoux  \n [link]   [comments]",

I seems to stem from a recent change in rsync behaviour I think.\n Before you had to prepend \\\\ to all your escapes when dealing with remote files in rsync, this in order to send the escapes to the remote machine.
