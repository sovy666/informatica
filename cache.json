(B) I haven't used a Linux desktop in over a Decade & a lot has changed, but I am trying to learn. (C) I tried googling this & my issues seems to be unique.\n I can't get my Steam Deck to recognize any USB wired input devices. Bluetooth works fine, but directly connecting a USB device (either through a dock or directly plugging in a single device with a USB-C to USB-C cable). Display out works when connecting a Dock, all devices I plug in directly will light up and start charging from the Deck, but no input devices are detected by the system.\n I have tried two different Docks, two sets of KB+M (my gaming ones off my main PC and a generic Dell Set), an 8BitDo SN30 game pad, and a Rii i8 mini KB+trackpad.\n None of them will show up when connected through USB, but both my Gaming mouse from corsair & the SN30 worked fine when connect through Bluetooth. The only things I have done with Desktop mode is try out Heroic Game Launcher and Lutris, install flat seal, and install ProtonUp-QT ... All done through the discovery application.\n The over all symptoms of this make me think that some kind of permission for USB PnP detection got turned off, but I don't know enough about Linux to start guessing at where to find those: any suggestions for how to fix this?\n    submitted by    /u/Xijit  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Ci troviamo nel periodo durante il quale ARM è solita annunciare le novità che debutteranno da qui a un anno sotto forma di prodotti commerciali.La società britannica, che ha visto sfumare l'acquisizione da parte di NVidia e che adesso è nel mirino di una cordata di imprese capeggiata da Qualcomm, ha annunciato la nuova generazione di CPU ARMv9 basate su core Cortex-X3 e Cortex-A715. ARM ha anche annunciato un Cortex-A510 'rinnovato'.\n\nPartendo dalla proposta più performante, il Cortex-X3 è un core focalizzato sulle prestazioni (+22% rispetto agli smartphone Android di punta basati su Cortex-X2). Secondo ARM i SoC basati su Cortex-X3 sarebbero fino al 34% più prestazionali rispetto ad esempio a un Intel Core i7 per notebook (28W).ARM fa riferimento anche a un aumento del valore IPC pari all'11% rispetto al Cortex-X2 che utilizza lo stesso processo produttivo.Non si parlato esplicitamente, in questo caso, di migliorie in fatto di efficienza energetica: l'azienda si è limitata a dire che Cortex-X3 consuma meno energia nella maggior parte dei casi rispetto al Cortex-X2.Il secondo nuovo core, Cortex-A715, raccoglie l'eredità del Cortex-A710: sarà il core 'a media potenza' in questi SoC che usano un'architettura composta da tre cluster fornendo un buon equilibrio tra potenza ed efficienza.",

Tante app sono in inglese e chi non è abituato a leggere spesso testi in questa o in altre lingue può realizzare di essere un po’ arrugginito per quello che riguarda la traduzione in italiano.Per tradurre testi nelle app Android, di seguito proponiamo tre possibili soluzioni: le prime due si basano sull'utilizzo di applicazioni sviluppate da Google, la terza fa leva su un'applicazione di terze parti davvero utile e semplice da usare.\nAndroid: tradurre testi in italiano con Google Traduttore\n L'app gratuita Google Traduttore si è da tempo arricchita di una comoda funzionalità chiamata Tocca per tradurre: essa consente di visualizzare una piccola 'bolla' sopra le altre app e di tradurre in italiano i testi presenti in qualunque app che ne consenta la selezione.Per utilizzare lo strumento basta installare il traduttore Google, fare clic sull'icona in alto a destra, scegliere Impostazioni quindi Tocca per tradurre.\n\nA questo punto si devono attivare le opzioni Tocca per tradurre e Mostra icona floating.\n\nL'icona di Google Translate compare sullo schermo: a questo punto si può aprire l'app Android di proprio interesse quindi selezionare il testo e scegliere Copia.\n\nToccando la 'bolla' del traduttore Google, si può incollare il testo copiato dall'app Android e ottenere immediatamente la traduzione in italiano.\n\nUna volta conclusa l'operazione di traduzione, la 'bolla' di Google Translate può essere disattivata dall'area delle notifiche di Android.L'unico problema, nel caso della soluzione basata su Google Translate, è che l'app Android deve consentire la selezione del testo da tradurre.\nTradurre testi dagli screenshot delle app con Google Lens\n Una soluzione alternativa per ottenere la traduzione in italiano di un testo scritto in un'altra lingua consiste nel creare uno screenshot del contenuto dell'app Android: di solito è possibile farlo premendo Volume giù+tasto accensione.",

Per sfruttare il potenziale di un elaboratore informatico e adattarne il funzionamento alle proprie necessità era necessario scrivere codice.Come racconta Steve Wozniak, cofondatore di un tempo, i sistemi di maggior successo di una volta erano così attraenti perché sollecitavano subito l'interesse dell'utente che era portato a sviluppare i suoi programmi con la possibilità di comunicare direttamente con l'hardware.Oggi sono disponibili strumenti e servizi che vengono incontro ad ogni possibile esigenza: essi solevano gli utenti dalla necessità di scrivere codice. Esistono anche nuovi strumenti basati sull'intelligenza artificiale che permettono di generare codice funzionante nei vari linguaggi di programmazione scrivendo semplicemente il nome di una funzione o descrivendo ciò che si vuole ottenere: GitHub Copilot e Amazon CodeWhisperer.Non c'è nulla di male: questi strumenti aiutano a concludere più velocemente lo sviluppo di un progetto dispensando il programmatore dallo scrivere codice di base o comunque che si ripete di frequente nei vari progetti.Sviluppare è un'attività stimolante che richiede una dose di logica e di creatività.",

          "description": "Per sua stessa natura un software antimalware non può non occupare risorse macchina, ad esempio processore e memoria. Il modulo di protezione che lavora in background deve infatti controllare in tempo reale le attività che vengono svolte sul sistema neutralizzando eventuali minacce.Microsoft Defender, la soluzione per la sicurezza integrata in Windows, si è evoluta molto dalle origini fino ad oggi, al punto che nel 2020 ha ottenuto il punteggio più alto nelle verifiche condotte da AV-Test. A dimostrazione che gli sforzi non sono stati vani.Dietro un'interfaccia molto semplice che in Windows 10 e 11 viene proposta come parte integrante della finestra Sicurezza di Windows, Microsoft Defender nasconde decine di funzionalità evolute che possono essere gestite con un programma gratuito come DefenderUI.Dicevamo che un antimalware ha sempre un certo impatto sulle prestazioni complessive del sistema: l'importante è che le risorse siano impegnate solo quando serve e in modo intelligente in modo da non affossare le performance del PC come accadeva con alcuni storici antivirus in passato.Non sono infrequenti casi in cui Microsoft Defender occupa stabilmente il processore per completare l'analisi del sistema: in caso di problemi è possibile applicare un semplice intervento che permette di limitare l'uso della CPU da parte di Defender.In questi giorni è emerso però un problema che sembra interessare tanti sistemi basati su CPU Intel (quelli equipaggiati con un processore AMD sono immuni alla problematica): Microsoft Defender occupa sempre un minimo quantitativo della CPU, anche quando non ce n'è effettivamente bisogno.",
