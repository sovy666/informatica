          "description": "When I encounter a bug in some Arch package, from time to time I do my part and try to track it down by taking the Arch PKGBUILD, compiling the code, flipping compile-time options, or modifying the source code, and generally just finding out why the code is not behaving as it should. Sometimes the problem is upstream, and I report it there, and it usually gets fixed. Sometimes the problem is not upstream, but in the actual Arch packaging.\n Note that I'm 1000% ready to give the Arch maintainers benefit of doubt: my assumption is that they are busy and overworked, like all of us are, and have lives to live outside of fixing Arch packaging bugs, like all of us do. Still, it's pretty frustrating to spend time -- it takes a few hours usually -- to diagnose a bug and propose a fix, and to see the bug just sitting there for months on end. \n So my question is, is the Arch project thinking about scaling up its efforts? As an example, for one bug I reported, I see the maintainer is maintaining 750+ packages. Another question I have is, what can we as users do to help speed up the process?\n I for one am hoping that one day we can have our PKGBUILDs in Git repositories, and that lowly peanut gallery members like myself can send pull requests to package maintainers, who then have to do not much more than reviewing the proposed changes, and merging them. This would still not work that well for someone who is maintaining 750+ packages, but at least it's less work than also fiddling with the PKGBUILDs and patches.\n    submitted by    /u/_j0057  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've come to find that the version in the official Arch repositories is still on the major version 1 instead of 2, while AWS CLI v2 has been released in early 2020.\n I've looked up online and found what I believe is the most likely reason why, namely the fact that Amazon refuses to publish a package to PyPI for v2.\n And this is totally understandable that maintainers would initially want to keep using the tried and tested version for a while. However it's two years later now and being capped to v1 makes users miss all new features (because v1 is apparently only receiving bugfixes until it dies), among those really important ones like SSO. Considering AWS is the biggest cloud provider around, I would venture to say providing the v2 at least in an another named package (in order to keep offering v1 too) is very important for the Arch community.\n Yes there's an AUR package but this kind of program clearly qualifies as official repo material to me, considering its sheer number of users, its power and thus dangerousness. \n Has there been a discussion about it ?\n    submitted by    /u/Atralb  \n [link]   [comments]",

There can be the occasional lag/stutter with animations, like going in/out of Overview mode or going in/out of the App Drawer for example. This is noticeable not just on Arch, but on other distros I've tested like Fedora, PopOS, Solus, etc, so it's not unique to just Arch, but more so to the Gnome DE and quite possibly my hardware too. \n I have an Acer Aspire E5-576G laptop, which has an Nvidia MX150/Intel hybrid setup, currently setup with EnvyControl, using the latest nvidia-dkms driver, to use the Nvidia GPU as the primary since I'm always connected to a power source. Since it's Nvidia, I still need to use Xorg for a majority of my workflow. I do like to test out Wayland every so often, but my default still needs to be Xorg for now.\n I'm currently using mutter v42.2-1 as my window manager, but I've noticed there are two other options available in the AUR: mutter-performance and mutter-dynamic-buffering\n I'm curious if these packages could offer any significantly noticeable improvement(s) under Xorg or if the gains are negligible under Xorg. \n I'm wondering for any other Nvidia and/or Xorg users out there that have tried either of these two AUR packages, how your experience has been and if you recommend one package over the other for any reason(s)? Would appreciate any feedback so I have an idea what to expect before I can test them out. My understanding is it looks like the patches work better under Wayland than Xorg, so I appreciate any comments from others that have already tried either of these patches, thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/dswhite85  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello Friends.\n I have tweaked the efly live system to facilitate persistent storage, so that changes are kept after rebooting.\n You can change keymap, timezone, language etc. and don't have to retype everything, when you decide to reboot. Everything stays.\n Installing packages and creating files is also possible without problems. The system will auto-expand at boot to the size of your stick. Usage as a hybrid rescue system / portable storage is possible.\n Creating the disk image yourself is very easy, if you are running an Arch Linux system. How to do that is explained on github.\n This is how you can place it on a stick:\n  wget https://github.com/flying-dude/efly/releases/download/latest/efly-live.img sudo cp efly-live.img /dev/sdX # replace sdX with the device node of your stick \n If you want to run it inside a VM, you need to truncate first:\n  wget https://github.com/flying-dude/efly/releases/download/latest/efly-live.img truncate --size=10G efly-live.img git clone https://github.com/flying-dude/efly efly/scripts/efly-qemu --uefi efly-live.img \n This is brand-new but so far it works really well. Let me know, if you are encountering issues.\n    submitted by    /u/flying-dude  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would like to have pure arch linux on the same drive but I've heard its not a good idea, which is strange because by that logic all laptop users shouldnt dual boot windows and linux. I guess it's safer if you never really use windows since windows has a lot of updates here and there? I never really use windows anyways. Right now I am dual booting windows and pop os on my tower and everything works fine. Just want to know if I can expect the same result with arch (assuming I do the long installation process correctly).

E quando si parla di SSD sono tante le tecnologie che rendono più veloci le unità a stato solido.Ma perché gli SSD sono più lenti se meno capienti?\nCosa significa IOPS\n Prendiamo in esame il valore IOPS nelle operazioni di lettura e scrittura random 4K delle unità SSD.IOPS, innanzi tutto, è acronimo di Input/Output Operations Per Second (si pronuncia eye-ops): si tratta di un valore che esprime il numero di operazioni che l'unità presa in esame è in grado di compiere in un secondo.Il valore di IOPS rilevato può comunque variare sulla base di molteplici fattori: la tipologia di operazioni di lettura e scrittura, il mix di modelli di accesso sequenziale e casuale, il numero di thread, la profondità della coda di lavoro, le dimensioni dei blocchi di dati, la configurazione del sistema, i driver, le operazioni svolte in background dal sistema operativo.Con la specifica IOPS viene data un'idea delle prestazioni di un SSD durante la lettura/scrittura dei dati random 4K posto che le performance di queste unità superano per ordini di grandezza quelle dei tradizionali hard disk magnetomeccanici.In un altro articolo abbiamo descritto le principali differenze tra hard disk e SSD.\nPerché un SSD meno capiente è meno veloce?\n Abbiamo già rilevato come le unità SSD meno capienti siano dichiarate come meno prestazionali rispetto a quelle di maggiori dimensioni.",

L'idea era quella di mettere a punto un sistema che tutti potessero utilizzare, per rendere l'informatica più popolare e proporre un'interfaccia user-friendly.I due riuscirono nell'intento se si considera che il successo commerciale fu enorme per quei tempi con più di 5 milioni di esemplari complessivamente venduti.Il modello originale poggiava il suo funzionamento su una CPU MOS 6502 a 1 MHz, offriva una grafica a colori, con una matrice del testo pari a 40 x 24 caratteri, uscita video composita, interfaccia a cassetta per l'archiviazione e otto slot di espansione interni.Veniva venduto in configurazioni variabili che andavano da 1.298 dollari con una dotazione di 4 KB di RAM a 2.638 dollari per 48 KB di RAM.",
