Gnome Wayland despite this still doesn't support VRR.\n How do these changes to the 5.18 kernel affect the way that VRR is normally enabled currently on DEs?

          "description": "I have a Packer configuration that connects to my VMware vCenter 7.0 host, creates a virtual machine, partitions the disks, installs Arch Linux using the Live CD, configures GRUB to use EFI, and reboots. Whenever the Packer reboots the virtual machine, it just boots up using the Live CD, not the installed version of Arch Linux.\n After some investigation, it turns out that the boot order for the UEFI always has the CDROM before the boot partition. If I manually select the boot partition, the newly installed Arch Linux boots up without issues. \n So I updated the install script to use efibootmgr to change the boot order. It's updated from the looks of things, but the CDROM still boots. Even when I use it to delete boot entries, it continues to kick the Live CD. When I change the EFI boot order manually in the vSphere client or disable entries, it will boot the installed Arch Linux. \n When I manually eject the CDROM after the reboot, then reboot it again, it will boot into Arch Linux. \n This leaves me with two questions: \n  \nHas anyone successfully installed Arch Linux on VMware vSphere in an unattended fashion?\n What's the best way to instruct Arch Linux to eject removable media before reboots?\n  \nA note about (2): I can't eject the disk after installation since the Live CD is still in use.\n    submitted by    /u/bloudraak  \n [link]   [comments]",

The connection generally works and a speedtest shows the expected speed, but for some reason it just takes forever to load websites.\n The problem seems to be the initial step of the connection. After typing an address and hitting enter, it takes like 10-20 seconds until anything loads, but as soon as it is loading, it's fast. E.g. loading a youtube page with a video takes 10s but as soon as the play button is there, the video plays fine.\n The problem does not exist when connecting via ethernet and also does not exist on other devices and it only appeared yesterday after upgrading the kernel to linux 5.18.1. I didn't find any bug reports or forum threads related to that issue tho.\n What I (unsuccessfully) tried so far:\n  \nrebooting router\n changing DNS server, which didn't help\n connecting via ethernet => works fine, but doesn't fix the problem because I do not have ethernet at my desk\n re-installing linux & linux-firmware\n  \nIf anybody could help me or give me some ideas what to even look for, would be super helpful!

          "description": "Hello,I'm trying to install video drivers for my system. I'm running arch off of a USB onto a Dell G15 laptop. It has a NVIDIA 3060 GPU and I think it has integrated Intel graphics. To log into my system I just use tty1 and then start X on login. I use i3.\n I've tried installing the NVIDIA package a couple times but it always leads to some sort of issue where my system completely stalls whenever I start X. Because of this, I'm pretty sure some sort of configuration is wrong, but it could be that I'm installing the wrong driver or even something else entirely.\n I'd be fine with only using the integrated Intel graphics, but for some reason, xrandr doesn't recognize my 2 external monitors that I connect via usbc dock.\n I've read through a a bunch of the wiki and done a decent amount of googling. Its entirely possible that I've missed something though. Any pointers in the right direction would be really really helpful. \n Edit: I know the title says Audio and video, but I've decided to work on things one at a time haha.\n    submitted by    /u/SyntaxAerror  \n [link]   [comments]",

I rarely watch videos on my laptop, so I am not sure since when this issue has been there.\n When I try to play a video, the video just freeze. I can seek the bar on the player, but it will only change the frame shown. The video will keep freezing.\n Not only on Reddit, but on youtube as well.\n You can see the issue in action here: https://i.imgur.com/XbSlmfv.mp4\n Hopefully someone can give me an idea to try.

A partire dall'armadio stradale fino all'utenza dell'abbonato (rete secondaria) il collegamento prosegue con il tradizionale doppino telefonico in rame.Nel caso delle connessioni fibra misto rame FTTC (Fiber-to-the-Cabinet) il cavo fibra arriva fino all'armadio in strada ('cabinet') mentre nello schema FTTE (Fiber-to-the-Exchange) la tratta in rame è ancora più lunga.",

Tra l'altro le stesse app UWP sono state ufficialmente accantonate per guardare a Windows App SDK (Project Reunion), kit di sviluppo che torna a strizzare l'occhio agli storici programmi Win32.Così, come abbiamo visto, Microsoft Store è diventato uno strumento pronto ad accogliere anche applicazioni Win32, .NET, Xamarin, Electron, React Native, Java e Progressive Web Apps (PWA), sia in Windows 10 che in Windows 11.Insieme all'arrivo delle applicazioni Win32, nel corso dell'ultimo anno la società di Redmond ha posto in campo diverse novità per rendere il Microsoft Store più attraente sia per gli utenti che per gli sviluppatori.Nel negozio online sono già stati inseriti browser come Firefox e Opera GX, CCleaner e Audacity.Presto Microsoft renderà molto più semplice reinstallare le applicazioni scaricate attraverso lo store, cosa che può essere davvero pratica quando si reinstalla Windows o si passa a un nuovo PC.Il Microsoft Store sarà anche in grado di riconoscere le applicazioni correntemente in esecuzione rimandando il loro aggiornamento a un secondo momento.",

          "description": "Ormai buona parte dei router più moderni, compresi quelli non espressamente rivolti a un'utenza professionale, offrono la possibilità di creare un server OpenVPN. Si tratta di uno strumento che consente di collegarsi a distanza con la rete locale dell'azienda, dell'ufficio o di casa: tutti i dati trasferiti da e verso la LAN saranno automaticamente crittografati rendendone impossibile il monitoraggio, la lettura, la modifica e la sottrazione da parte di soggetti terzi.Stabilire un collegamento OpenVPN a distanza con il proprio server permette di proteggere il contenuto dei pacchetti dati usando reti altrui (ad esempio WiFi pubbliche o aperte) e allo stesso tempo dà modo di collegarsi alle risorse condivise in rete locale come se il dispositivo in uso fosse attestato sulla LAN.Il router e il server NAS che permettono la configurazione di un server OpenVPN tipicamente consentono di specificare se il client collegato a distanza possa anche 'navigare' in rete usando l'indirizzo IP pubblico oppure se abbia soltanto la facoltà di accedere alle risorse locali.Cliccando sul pulsante o sul link che permette di esportare il file di configurazione OpenVPN si ottiene un file .ovpn utile per impostare qualunque client e consentirne la connessione remota.Il consiglio è quello di esportare il file .ovpn quindi di aprirlo con un editor di testo (come Notepad++) e verificare l'indirizzo IP riportato nella prima riga.",

          "description": "Uno degli strumenti più utilizzati per creare un server VPN è il protocollo OpenVPN. Insieme con WireGuard, la stella nascente in continua crescita, e lo storico IPSec, OpenVPN è uno dei protocolli più utilizzati in assoluto per connettersi a distanza con la rete locale della propria azienda, dell'ufficio o di casa.La connessione VPN avviene in totale sicurezza ed è possibile accedere da remoto alle risorse condivise come se il dispositivo in uso fosse fisicamente connesso alla LAN via WiFi o cavo Ethernet.In un altro articolo abbiamo visto quanto conta la scelta del protocollo sul funzionamento di una VPN.Il client OpenVPN per Windows mostra in fase di connessione una piccola finestra di dialogo che consente di specificare nome utente e password per l'effettuazione del collegamento. Spuntando la casella Ricorda la password, la password usata per la connessione al server VPN remoto viene memorizzata in locale in forma cifrata.\n\nSe si fosse dimenticato la password associata a un profilo OpenVPN creato lato client, come si potrebbe fare per recuperarla?\nRecuperare le password OpenVPN in forma cifrata\n Supponiamo di aver installato il client OpenVPN su un altro PC Windows.",

Questi ultimi, oltre a collegare le due diverse interfacce, convertono attivamente il segnale mentre viene trasmesso, indipendentemente dal tipo di segnale emesso o ricevuto.Tra i dispositivi attivi di Techly, vi è il nuovo adattatore IADAP DP-HDMIF8K da DisplayPort 1.4 a HDMI che consente di collegare un DisplayPort 20 pin maschio a un HDMI 19 pin femmina.Questo convertitore supporta una risoluzione video 8K a 30Hz, perfetto anche per lo streaming video e per il trasferimento di sessioni gaming da un computer a un televisore HDTV.",
