          "description": "I had to go back and have a look at the wiki to ensure I wasn't going crazy, but the Arch Linux principles are, and have always been, pretty crystal clear. While the language has been refined over the years, they are still the same in spirit as they were 10+ years ago when I first read them. If you haven't done so, consider giving the Arch Linux overview a read.\n Yes, it does bother me when someone posts a thread to this sub questioning the quality of a product that they get at no cost, complaining about problems caused by upstream bugs, and also complaining about solutions offered by community members. It bothers me a great deal and if you have read and agree with the Arch Linux principles, it should bother you, too.\n I do respond to such threads with links to the wiki and snark, because I'm genuinely offended at the implications of such posts. The implication being that Arch isn't meeting the user's needs in certain areas, and that someone else is responsible for shoring up those shortcomings to fulfill their expectations. And what really gets my goat, is that what they often consider failures of the distro are actually features, in light of user centrality. It would be far more constructive for a user to check for/open bug reports, and would constitute an actual semblance of contribution to the community, instead of complaining.\n Edit: markdown\n    submitted by    /u/krakenfury_  \n [link]   [comments]",

The pytproject.toml specifies the build-backend = \"setuptools.build_meta\".\n However, this is the first python package I have attempted to package for the AUR which appears to be using setuptools but does not have a setup.py file. I attempted to use the \"Standards based\" approach on the current version of https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Python_package_guidelines but no wheel is found in the packaging step:\n Traceback (most recent call last): File \"/usr/lib/python3.10/runpy.py\", line 196, in _run_module_as_main return _run_code(code, main_globals, None, File \"/usr/lib/python3.10/runpy.py\", line 86, in _run_code exec(code, run_globals) File \"/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/installer/__main__.py\", line 85, in <module> _main(sys.argv[1:], \"python -m installer\") File \"/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/installer/__main__.py\", line 73, in _main with WheelFile.open(args.wheel) as source: File \"/usr/lib/python3.10/contextlib.py\", line 135, in __enter__ return next(self.gen) File \"/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/installer/sources.py\", line 122, in open with zipfile.ZipFile(path) as f: File \"/usr/lib/python3.10/zipfile.py\", line 1249, in __init__ self.fp = io.open(file, filemode) FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'dist/*.whl' \n The README.md of course, recommends simply pip install but this is not acceptable for a dependency of the primary AUR package which I maintian.

But this didn't happen in normal DE (Plasma). There were only Xorg, plasmashell, and steam using the GPU. Weirdly, nvtop didn't show that steam was using more VRAM, only that the total memory usage getting fill up. Completely quit steam temporarily solved the issue. But it happened again after reopening steam.\n After one hour troubleshooting, I ended up delete ~/.local/share/steam and let it reinstall and that seemed to finally fix it. Don't exactly know what could have caused steam to behave like that.\n PS: Now I know that steam consistently uses about 100 MB of VRAM just sitting in the tray, I might have to reconsider letting it run in the background.\n    submitted by    /u/BillTran163  \n [link]   [comments]",

For example:\n  \nThe first sentence of the Arch wiki article on dotfiles states \"User-specific application configuration is traditionally stored in so called dotfiles\" (Source)\n In the Hacker News article on using a git bare repo, it uses --work-tree=$HOME when setting up the repo, so I don't think it would track any system-wide configs i.e. in the /etc folder. (Source)\n  \nIn regards to system-wide configs, the author of yadm mentioned:\n  \nThis isn’t a use I would particularly endorse, as there are generally other configuration management tools for system level configurations; Ansible, Puppet, etc. (Source)\n  \nHowever, it seems like Ansible and Puppet are tools more geared towards servers, rather than PCs? (Correct me if I'm wrong here please.)\n If not using Ansible or Puppet, are there any other best practices for version controlling system-wide configs for PCs?\n I'd like to use the git bare method, so maybe I just set --work-tree=/, then add the /etc/ config files to the git repo as needed?\n Or, put the system-wide config files in my $HOME directory, then symlink them to /etc/?\n For context, I'm trying to set up an \"override\" sudoer file in /etc/sudoers.d/\n EDIT: Added a source link for the HN article (forgot to add it on first draft)\n    submitted by    /u/moonlighter69  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now that I am here I am having a bit of issues with the workflow. Is there any good information about efficient ways to search for and install packages?\n Either the terminal or a GUI works fine if I want to install a single, specific package. Otherwise I find it pretty frustrating and slow. \n I have repeatedly read advice that it's better to use the terminal but how do you do this without endless copy and pasting? With a GUI you can click click click to select what is desired. In the terminal it is very cumbersome. It's hard to read a list of dozens of results on the terminal. \n However both pamac-manager and especially octopi GUI package managers have a big problem which is that if you select multiple packages for install and there is a problem with any of them, the whole job fails. It's hard to figure out where the problem is. \n Also would like to learn about the different variations of the same package that are usually available and why I would choose one or the other. Is there a way to specify a preference? I have found that accidentally mixing them causes dependency issues. \n I would appreciate any advice or links to reading on the subject. The documentation for the package manager and related tools themselves do not seem really to contain this kind of information and not sure how or where to look.\n    submitted by    /u/sprayfoamparty  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am new here :D So I am trying to install arch on my laptop and everything is more or less straightforward except disk partition part, because I have two partitions on my nwme drive. One is being used by windows 11 another is for linux. So I have used ubuntu/ mint before, and I had really no problem installing them, but arc is fucking with my newb brain. Anyway first I have tried to do old fashioned comand line install and I have made partitions( boot/swap/file system) on /dev/nvme0n1p5(p1/p2/p3)but when I wanted to format them on the next step with the command, it would come back as partition is not existing. Ok, so then I used script to install, which also does not show partitions i created before. It shows there is free space but in selection it shows nothing. I booted back to windows just to format that unpartitioned space to exfat so I know which partition i need to work with, but this is where I left confused. Do i need to delete this partition? Should i split it in 3 partitions again for boot, swap and file system for arch or should i create just one and script will do the rest? I really dont want to delete all my partitions accidentally so I am asking for little help. Thanks 🙏\n    submitted by    /u/Royal_Mongoose2907  \n [link]   [comments]",

Come altri servizi VPN, anche ProtonVPN consente di superare censure, limitazioni geografiche, raggiungere siti Web e servizi diversamente non fruibili, proteggere i dati che si scambiano con i server remoti durante l'utilizzo di connessioni potenzialmente insicure (si pensi a reti WiFi pubbliche o aperte).Servizi quali ProtonMail e ProtonVPN sono erogati da un'azienda (Proton Technologies AG) con sede in Svizzera: essi si attengono alle normative del Paese elvetico e alla sua giurisdizione.Qualche tempo fa l'azienda fu costretta a comunicare l'indirizzo IP reale di un utente connesso con i suoi servizi tanto che quel comportamento destò un vespaio di polemiche e determinò l'arrivo del padre del World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee come responsabile per gli aspetti legati alla privacy.",

C'è ancora l'interfaccia a schede nella parte superiore della finestra per passare da uno strumento all'altro ma per chi è abituato alla visualizzazione più semplice di OneNote per Windows 11 è disponibile un pulsante che permette di passare a una barra multifunzione semplificata.A parte gli aspetti estetici, che hanno comunque la loro valenza, il nuovo OneNote si mette in evidenza per il supporto e il riconoscimento della scrittura ('ink').",

In breve si tratta di workstation virtuali che sfruttano lo stesso schema utilizzato con Windows 365 e permettono di utilizzare sistemi già preconfigurati con tutto ciò che è necessario per sviluppare applicazioni con i vari linguaggi, framework, piattaforme, componenti, editor, ambienti di programmazione e così via.\n\nGestire workstation utilizzate dagli sviluppatori per creare le applicazioni è oggi fondamentale per stare al passo con i ritmi dei moderni.",
