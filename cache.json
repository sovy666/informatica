I tried adding the below to my /usr/share/sddm/scripts/Xsession\n nvidia-settings -a \"[gpu:0]/GPUFanControlState=1\" -a \"[fan:0]/GPUTargetFanSpeed=30\" -a \"[fan:1]/GPUTargetFanSpeed=30\" \n It doesn't seem to activate when SDDM starts. It seems like nvidia-settings doesn't run at all unless a user is logged in graphically. To confirm this, I logged in to tty2 after SDDM started and was sitting at the user login screen. I ran nvidia-settings and it failed, however after adding DISPLAY=:0, it failes with a different error about MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE missing.\n Both of those are kind of beside the problem though. If this was a headless server that wasn't running X, how would I go about using nvidia-settings to set the fanspeed?\n    submitted by    /u/bitwaba  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's only really a minor inconvenience as I have to do Ctrl+Atl+F2, sign in, and then \"sudo systemctl start lightdm\" and we're good, but if there is a fix, I'd like some help finding it as I've found some suggestions online of editing conf files and reinstalling the packages but that hasn't really been helping. \n 2) Monitor freezes at times when in fullscreen. The issue was worse on GNOME, as it was happening with youtube videos, mpv, and watching disney+ in a browser when fullscreen. However, it also would happen to games, where something might happen, i may get a desktop notification or I try upping my volume and the fullscreen image for the game freezes and the computer has to be hard shut off and restarted in order to get back to the desktop. to my chagrin, budgie still has the same issue. due to this, borderless window is preferred but a lot of games either just have fullscreen or windowed, so I'd like to get an idea of what would be the issue with the fullscreen freezing. \n Switching DE's obviously wouldn't be preferrable. I switched from GNOME to Budgie in order to try to see if Budgie could fix some of the issues that my system would have with GNOME, but it seems that the fullscreen freezes, which is the bigger problem, carried over. Any help would be very much appreciated, thank you. \n DE: Budgie\n WM: Mutter (Budgie)\n CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X\n GPU: ASUS AMD Radeon RX 6600 \n random thought that could be garbage. to my understanding, my GNOME install also used mutter as the WM, so I kind of wonder if the fullscreen issue is a WM problem..?\n    submitted by    /u/kabimbusman  \n [link]   [comments]",

I typically run gminer in the background all the time while I am using my system, and this doesn't cause any noticeable impact on Windows.\n I have been trying some different distros, and with PopOS and Fedora using proprietary nvidia drivers for my 3080Ti, I have the same experience where I can mine in the background and it doesn't appear to have any impact on the user experience.\n When I use anything Arch based though and install the nvidia DKMS drivers, I am getting very bad graphical lag when trying to use and move around windows while running gminer, to the point where the system isn't really useable.\n Some additional info: I am using GNOME in all the linux variations I have been testing, and I have enabled the full composition pipeline in nvidia settings on arch, but that didn't seem to make a difference. I have also tried with both normal Linux kernel and Zen kernel. I have tried archcraft, endeavour, manjaro, and xero for arch distributions to see if it was some weird distro specific thing, but I'm having the same issue on all of them.\n Any reason I would only be seeing the poor performance on Arch-based systems, and is there any way to optimize?\n    submitted by    /u/failf0rward  \n [link]   [comments]",

We weren't seeded by AMD for this launch, leading us to anticipate that it's not too good for Linux gaming / not their target market. But after the great success I've had with AMD Milan-X performance on Linux, I was very eager to try out this consumer CPU with the 3D-stacked L3 cache and ended up purchasing a 5800X3D. Indeed the Ryzen 7 5800X3D turned out to be disappointing for Linux gaming performance but the 5800X3D was very interesting for a range of other technical workloads and making me very excited for future Ryzen CPUs with 3D V-Cache.",
