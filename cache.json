          "description": "I've been using secure boot with systemd to auto-decrypt my LUKS system partition on boot for about a year on all my bare metal arch systems, but my headless server has been having issues since 251.1-1 was installed. My desktop and laptop auto-decrypt just fine. BIOS version hasn't changed between systemd updates. It's using AMD fTPM.\n 251.2-1 hit my server but the issue continues. When systemd-boot reaches the disk decryption for root, it takes 5 seconds to run two cryptsetup jobs (without error) to decrypt as if it's working, but then prompts for a passphrase. If I wipe the TPM2 slot, it skips that 2-job step and instantly prompts for passphrase. Entering the passphrase will allow the boot to continue successfully.\n I'm using PCRs 0 and 7, and they have the exact same values after each boot according to tpm2_pcrread.\n I tried enrolling with option --tpm2-with-pin=no, clearing TPM from BIOS, enabling all sha1 and sha256 banks, wiping tpm2 cryptenroll slots and turning TPM off + power cycling and setting it all up again but still no progress. It's always the same 5 sec cryptsetup jobs that results in a LUKS passphrase prompt. My systemd-boot entry hasn't changed since I first set it up, and the rd.luks options are all the exact same from when it worked before.\n Tried to re-cryptenroll the root by sdX and by-uuid. A secondary storage disk decrypts using crypttab just fine (using keyfile, not TPM).\n Output of bootctl status seems good:\n System: Firmware: UEFI 2.70 (American Megatrends 5.17) Secure Boot: enabled (user) TPM2 Support: yes Boot into FW: supported Current Boot Loader: Product: systemd-boot 251.2-1-arch \n I can't find any related errors in journalctl, where else could I troubleshoot this issue?\n    submitted by    /u/Terry-51C  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm dual booting with Windows 11 and windows works just fine with external microphone and headphones, so I don't think the issue is with hardware.\n Here is a screenshot of pavucontrol when nothing is plugged in and and here is a screenshot after I plugged in the external microphone.

What shared libs does arch use for these functions?\n Basically I am trying to map a steam controller to keyboard events, but I want to add my own logic via python.\n I can either have steam map the controller to keyboard events, then consume those and output new key events, or just have steam output controller events (not sure what protocol this is) and consume those.\n I need the events to be input and output globally, as this is a control layer i want for all apps.\n Any advice is appreciated, thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/coffeecofeecoffee  \n [link]   [comments]",

The issue is delta uses the syntax highlight cache created by bat. bat introduced a breaking change to this cache in v0.21. delta was updated to work with this cache update in v0.13, but it's not backwards compatible with the old cache format. the git-delta package was update to v0.13, but bat is stuck on v0.20. \n What's the process for getting a community package updated save marking it as outdated? I thought opening a bug would be the correct course of action, but the bug list explicitly says not to do that for outdated packages. I'm happy to update the package myself if the maintainer is busy, I just need to know where to start.\n    submitted by    /u/giggly_kisses  \n [link]   [comments]",

Everything works great except that I can only get a display if I disable dynamic power mode. Recently my pc has started to completely lock up when I leave the pc alone for more than 10 minutes, requiring a force restart. The only thing that makes sense to me is that these two options are linked and the gpu is causing issues. I have three monitors and when I try to wake the machine, one turns on but the other two remain off and the entire setup freezes. I have scoured the net for this one, setting amdgpu in the mkinitcpio hooks, swapping drivers moving my install to a brand new but identical machine etc. Has anyone else had any luck with overcoming this issue?

Chrome, ad esempio, usa la sua 'ricetta' per liberare memoria scaricando le schede che non si utilizzano. Scrivendo chrome://discards nella barra degli indirizzi si ottengono informazioni sullo stato di ciascuna scheda visualizzata nel browser.Allo stesso modo, scrivendo edge://discards nella barra degli indirizzi di Edge si ottengono informazioni molto simili anche se il criterio usato è differente.Parlando dei migliori browser per la gestione della memoria e delle schede aperte abbiamo visto che la funzione che si occupa di eliminare dalla RAM il contenuto delle schede inutilizzate si chiama Schede in sospensione.Accedendo alle impostazioni di Edge e cliccando su Sistema e prestazioni, si può notare come il browser ponga in sospensione le schede aperte dopo circa 5 minuti di inutilizzo.",

          "description": "In un comunicato elaborato a più mani e firmato dalle principali agenzie che si occupano di cybersecurity e sicurezza nazionale (FBI, NSA e CISA) gli Stati Uniti affermano di aver individuato una serie di collegamenti tra attacchi informatici che hanno preso di mira aziende di ogni livello e gruppi hacking cinesi finanziati dallo stato.Nella nota diramata dalle tre principali agenzie USA, si legge che già dal 2020 i criminali informatici avrebbero avviato una pesante campagna di aggressione bersagliando dispositivi di rete ampiamente utilizzati sia nelle piccole imprese che nelle aziende di grandi dimensioni.Sfruttando vulnerabilità di sicurezza già conosciute, tutte classificate con un corrispondente identificativo CVE, i malintenzionati hanno usato tali strumenti per farsi largo nelle reti altrui, monitorare il traffico di rete e sottrarre dati riservati, anche mediante l'installazione di client gestiti da remoto attraverso appositi server command & control.La presa di posizione mette nero su bianco anche le vulnerabilità nei dispositivi Cisco, Citrix, DrayTek, D-Link, Fortinet, MikroTik, Netgear, Pulse, QNAP e Zyxel che sono state sfruttate.",

          "description": "Prima del lancio del più suo recente sistema operativo, a ottobre 2021, Microsoft aveva promesso che gli utenti di Windows 7 e versioni successive avrebbero potuto aggiornare gratis a Windows 11 a patto che il sistema soddisfi i requisiti hardware minimi fissati per l'installazione del nuovo sistema operativo, peraltro piuttosto stringenti se paragonati con quelli di Windows 10.Un programma gratuito come WhyNotWin11 offre tutte le informazioni circa la possibilità di aggiornare a Windows 11 chiarendo eventualmente quali requisiti non sono rispettati dal sistema in uso.Con poco sforzo, in realtà, si può installare Windows 11 anche su un PC non compatibile che quindi non soddisfa i requisiti minimi in termini di processore, RAM, utilizzo di BIOS UEFI e funzionalità Secure Boot, presenza e utilizzo di un chip TPM 2.0.Microsoft stessa ha confermato che è possibile installare Windows 11 su PC che non rispettano i requisiti ma ha anche precisato che in futuro si riserva di non distribuire più gli aggiornamenti attraverso Windows Update a tali dispositivi.",

          "description": "I servizi VPN consentono di superare censure, limitazioni geografiche e proteggere la sessione di navigazione online grazie all'utilizzo di un tunnel crittografato.Abbiamo visto nel dettaglio cos'è una VPN e quali sono i migliori servizi. Abbiamo inoltre spiegato cos'è la portabilità transforntaliera e perché le VPN sono invise alla maggior parte delle piattaforme di streaming.Presentando le caratteristiche più utili di una VPN abbiamo detto che i servizi maggiormente attenti alla privacy degli utenti stabiliscono la sede legale in Paesi che non si trovano nella lista Fourteen Eyes. L'elenco completo è pubblicato in questa pagina.In questo modo il gestore del servizio VPN non è tenuto a mantenere un file di log ovvero un registro contenente almeno gli indirizzi IP reali degli utenti e gli orari di connessione.È una nazione come l'India ad aver trovato il 'grimaldello' normativo per ostacolare l'utilizzo dei servizi VPN: tutti i provider saranno a breve obbligati a conservare un log delle connessioni effettuate dagli utenti per almeno 180 giorni.Così sia Surfshark che ExpressVPN hanno deciso di lasciare il Paese rimuovendo i server VPN fisicamente utilizzati in India.In un breve comunicato Surfshark spiega che un'azione normativa così radicale avrà un forte impatto sulla privacy di milioni di persone che vivono in India, sarà molto probabilmente controproducente e danneggerà fortemente la crescita del Paese.I portavoce di Surfshark hanno confermato che tutti i server fisici usati in India saranno spenti e disconnessi dalla rete.",

          "description": "I motivi per cui un PC si spegne da solo possono essere i più diversi. Di solito, però, la causa può essere hardware, software o esterna (ad esempio uno sbalzo di tensione o un blackout elettrico, più o meno breve).Cosa verificare se si verifica uno spegnimento improvviso del PC? Innanzi tutto è opportuno controllare, con gli strumenti software forniti dal produttore della scheda madre, e con il Visualizzatore eventi di Windows lo stato delle cose.\nSpegnimento improvviso del PC o schermata blu\n Quando si presenta un errore critico Windows genera una schermata blu e provvede a riavviare oppure a spegnere il sistema in uso. Per questo motivo spesso non ci si accorge nemmeno della schermata blu che non appare stabilmente a video.Per ovviare a questo problema e avere il tempo materiale, in caso di comparsa di una schermata blu, di leggere e annotare il messaggio d'errore restituito, basta premere Windows+R, digitare sysdm.cpl ,3, cliccare su Impostazioni nel riquadro Avvio e ripristino quindi disattivare la casella Riavvia automaticamente.\n\nIn un altro articolo abbiamo visto cosa può provocare una schermata blu o BSOD (Blue-screen-of-Death) e come risalire all'errore restituito da Windows.Nell'articolo abbiamo presentato l'utilità BlueScreenView che estrae dal registro degli eventi di Windows tutti quelli riferibili alla comparsa di una schermata blu.In alternativa si può premere Windows+X quindi scegliere Windows PowerShell (amministratore) in Windows 10 o Terminale Windows (Admin) in Windows 11 quindi impartire il seguente comando:$ErrorActionPreference='SilentlyContinue'; Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{logname='Application';id=1001}Si otterrà la lista delle schermate blu eventualmente comparse.",

          "description": "Sugli iPhone c'è un misterioso problema che coinvolge la batteria. Il problema riguarda la percentuale dell'indicatore di carica della batteria dell'iPhone, che può essere completamente sballato, passare dal 45% al 12% in un secondo o, viceversa, passare da 18% al 43% un secondo dopo averlo messo in carica. In pratica l'iPhone si scarica subito, anche se teoricamente avrebbe dovuto durare di più, come se la batteria fosse fallata.\n In altri casi, può capitare che dopo aver tenuto in carica tutta la notte il telefono, lo si prenda la mattina e lo si ritrovi scarico o quasi. Se anche noi siamo vittime di un iPhone che si scarica subito o che mostra una durata della carica completamente sballata, vediamo insieme come fare per calibrare la batteria e farla durare di più.\n LEGGI ANCHE -> Come v…",
