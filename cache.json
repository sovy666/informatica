          "description": "I installed arch a few days ago everything was fine until i ran pacman -Syu then after reboot I couldn't get it to boot. Eventually I gave up and reinstalled arch, everything was fine again and the same thing happened after running -Syu. I looked at the pacman.log file and downgraded the kernel, it still won't boot. I have systemd-boot and arch.conf looks the same as when it was working fine. I've tried mkinitcpio -P and -p linux as well as pacman -S linux all in chroot nothing has changed. The only thing i can find that is strange is that uname -srm and neofetch show a different kernel version(5.18.1) than the one I have installed which is 5.18.3. I don't know if this means anything but I can't see anything else wrong. Also pacman -Syu installed 5.18.5 which i downgraded back to 5.18.3. I have an amd gpu and cpu as well.\n    submitted by    /u/knowoneunknown  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is my list of autostart apps: Discord, EasyEffects service, GWE, OpenRGB, Yakuake, qBittorrent and ProtonVPN. Out of all of those, the following worked initially or after I removed the entries and added them back in: EasyE, OpenRGB and Yakuake. The applications that failed to start work properly if I just run them from the application menu.\n I took a look at the journald log, and for all of the apps that failed to start, they showed something similar to this:\n /run/user/1000/systemd/generator.late/app-discord\\x2dstable@autostart.service:18: WorkingDirectory= path is not absolute, ignoring: Starting Discord... app-discord\\x2dstable@autostart.service: Main process exited, code=exited, status=1/FAILURE app-discord\\x2dstable@autostart.service: Failed with result 'exit-code'. Failed to start Discord. \n The ones that did start showed no such messages.\n I tried to modify those files under /run/user etc. but realized that they get altered on boot.

Disponibile in versione on-premise e in cloud, SGBox propone una piattaforma SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) che si occupa di monitorare in tempo reale la rete dell'azienda e segnalare tempestivamente eventuali anomalie.Oltre al sistema di monitoraggio SGBox integra una funzione per la scansione di eventuali vulnerabilità, un'altra per l'analisi dei log (con la possibilità di metterli in correlazione ed individuare situazioni di rischio), un sistema per verificare la presenza di eventuali errori di configurazione software con una grande attenzione per i permessi assegnati alle varie risorse accessibili in LAN.SGBox è anche in grado di controllare le attività svolte dagli utenti (ad esempio dai dipendenti e dai collaboratori) in modo da far emergere comportamenti pericolosi o potenzialmente tali (User Behavior Analytics).\nArriva il monitoraggio delle installazioni di Active Directory\n Active Directory è uno dei software più utilizzati in azienda ma allo stesso tempo è una delle piattaforme che più spesso viene sfruttata dai criminali informatici per aggredire le imprese di qualunque dimensione.Proteggere Active Directory è diventata quindi una necessità sempre più pressante: trattandosi di un software nato oltre 20 anni fa, con il tempo si sono 'stratificati' errori di configurazione e problematiche di sicurezza di vario genere che oggi, purtroppo, fanno sentire tutto il loro 'peso'.L'attacco a un'installazione di Active Directory può cominciare con la ricezione di un'email truffaldina e l'apertura di un allegato.",

Tuttavia, non tutte le implementazioni della rete mobile di quinta generazione sono uguali: con il termine 5G Standalone (5G SA) viene fatto riferimento a una rete capace di autosostenersi senza dipendere da nessun'altra tecnologia sottostante.Le reti 5G SA assicurano molteplici benefici in termini di prestazioni in downstream e in upstream (compresa la riduzione della latenza), copertura, riduzione dei consumi energetici e sicurezza. Inoltre consentono l'utilizzo di caratteristiche evolute come il networking slicing ovvero un meccanismo che abilita un'efficace gestione e ripartizione delle risorse disponibili tra i clienti mobili garantendo la capacità di ogni singolo collegamento di rete.Di recente avevamo parlato di Dynamic End-user Boost, una soluzione che proprio Ericsson ha presentato per consentire agli utenti di migliorare la connessione proprio quando ne hanno più bisogno.Le network slice, spiegano Ericsson e TIM, sono porzioni di rete logiche virtuali che supportano diversi casi applicativi con caratteristiche e requisiti particolari.",

Dad will have spatial audio and a choice between Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode.\n    \nHigh-fidelity audio features on the AirPods Max with a dynamic driver designed by Apple. Spatial audio with dynamic head tracking will allow Dad to feel like he’s sitting in a theater listening to a performance, whether that’s classical music or classic rock.

There’s a very good reason for this: Bluetooth speakers have effectively replaced every kind of music player, and in the 21st Century, they are all you will ever need to play music and radio.\n    \nShopping for the right one is the problem. The question you have to bear in mind when buying speakers is “What are you going to use it for?” And more importantly, “Where?” The answer to this question defines your choice, as speakers are custom-made for different uses. This review takes the Tronsmart Trip, a Bluetooth speaker that is very specific.\n    \nOutdoor Sounds\n    \nThe Tronsmart Trip is a Bluetooth travel speaker. It’s designed to be light and portable yet powerful. It’s made to take a few knocks: it’s waterproof and dust-proof up to the IPX7 standard. While it is out of the box a mono speaker, it can team wirelessly with compatible Tronsmart speakers to provide stereo using its SoundPulse technology.\n   \n \n   \nThe case is covered in a tough...

          "description": "Unlike WhatsApp, Telegram doesn’t allow users to backup chats to a cloud service. That’s because Telegram is a cloud platform in itself that saves all your data (chats, photos, videos, etc.) in its own cloud servers automatically. Therefore, your chats will not be deleted if you change phones without making a backup. But, if you still want to save the backup offline or send your chat history to someone, you can export Telegram chats. Let’s check both methods to do so quickly and efficiently.\n    \nNote: You can export Telegram chat history only from the Telegram desktop app and not from its mobile apps.\n   \n\nContent\n\n1.
