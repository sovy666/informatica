          "description": "This sounds like a easy question but it has been a long time and I can't figure out the why.\n In any Linux I've tried, closing the lid and reopening it makes it a black screen, no input, devices disabled, and the processor fan goes to the MAX. Not kidding. It gets LOUD. In normal operation this barely ever happens if at all.\n I've done my research. It seems to be a problem with Bay Trail Processors (which my Pentium N3450 is), relating to something called the \"CState\" of the processor (whatever that is). Setting intel_idle.max_cstate=1 should've done the trick.\n The thing is, it doesn't. My laptop doesn't do what I want. I have to always set closing the lid to do nothing on the power settings of whatever I'm using.\n On Windows this doesn't ocurr at all, the system is able to suspend just fine. It seems to dislike Linux.\n Does someone have a 2nd opinion on what could I do?

So I’ve recently bought an asus vivobook s15 with amd ryzen with the igpu and I’ve started to install arch on it, and after exiting the live environment I felt that system freezes and I installed kde and it crashes all the time and it’s completely unusable. ( I installed amd open source driver for gpu and amd microcode for cpu and it even freezes when I try ctr alt f2 or the others) so I’m wondering what did I do wrong ( btw a reinstall did not help). I would be really glad if you can help me get this running cause it’s my first time running arch on a new laptop. Thanks again :)\n    submitted by    /u/sirius1377  \n [link]   [comments]",

I tried making a hotspot with my phone my it would also not connect.\n Checking dmesg I could see it would randomly authenticate and assosciate but eventually I would get a: wlan0: deauthenticating from MAC_ADDRESS by local choice (Reason: 3=DEAUTH_LEAVING)\n After doing some research I found this could be a NetworkManager wpa_supplicant concurrency problem, so I tried doing: sudo systemctl disable --now wpa_supplicant\n And turns out after doing this it could actually connect to my wifi (not to my phone hotspot tho). But I quickly realized it was so slow to the point it was unusable, when on my phone it's working just fine.\n Checking dmesg again the only odd thing I could see if plenty of audit messages for NetworkManager\n I don't think this is a firmware issue because it literally went from working fine to not working without me doing any upgrades it touching configuration. I tried restoring a ystem Timeshift snapshot but it also did not help. Does anybody have an idea of where I should look into next?\n    submitted by    /u/kylwaR  \n [link]   [comments]",

Google Drive sync handled all the syncing between my local copy and Google Drive copy. \n My question is: How to set this up in Arch?\n I am aware that an official Google Drive client does not exist (although it has been promised by Google). I would rather not switch cloud provider as I am already paying Google for some extra storage. \n I am aware of Insync, but do not want to pay extra for a client. I would also prefer to have it open source. I have been looking at Rclone, but it seems that two-way sync is not possible (I would be glad to hear if I am wrong though). \n Preferably I want the sync to be handled automatically. But I am also fine with manually pushing/pulling. Conflicts should be rare and I am fine with manually handling those. \n Has anyone set this up or has any tips to setting this up?

Because my laptop happens to have two ssd slots (one of which is unoccupied) I wanted to take the arch ssd out of the enclosure and into my laptops second ssd slot. My expectation is to use both windows and arch in a dual-boot manner but without the disadvantages of dual-boot (two seperate ssd's: lesser chance of things going wrong, not tight on space, etc.). \n Yesterday I have opened up my laptop for the first time and installed the arch ssd into the empty slot and put the laptop back together. When I start the laptop, I can choose between arch and windows but when I boot arch, the following error occurs: \n \"ERROR: device ‘UUID=<device\\_uuid>’ not found. Skipping fsck\"\n I know that this error is occuring because the UUID is different now that it is in an ssd slot instead of being connected by USB. So, naturally I have to somehow edit the UUID that the OS searches for when booting.

Abbiamo visto perché il chip Apple M1 e i suoi successori sono così veloci e come la storia della Mela sia contraddistinta da rivoluzionari cambi di architettura.Sul versante PC la situazione è più complessa perché, ad esempio, nel caso di Windows il problema principale resta legato alla corretta gestione dell'emulazione: le prestazioni nell'esecuzione delle applicazioni Win32 su ARM sono ancora lontane da quelle che si sperimentano con un approccio nativo. A questo proposito, in un altro nostro articolo ci eravamo chiesti cosa farebbero Intel e AMD se il mercato dei PC guardasse ad ARM con ancora maggiore interesse.Per adesso, oltre che sui dispositivi mobili, dove l'architettura ARM è leader incontrastata, l'architettura della società britannica di nuovo sulla piazza dopo l'accordo di acquisizione sfumato con NVidia, in ambito server e data center le quote di mercato sono in continua crescita.\n\nL'immagine è di der8auer.",

          "description": "Sulla suite di protocolli TCP/IP basa il suo funzionamento l'intera rete Internet.Il protocollo IP si occupa di gestire l'indirizzamento dei nodi e l'instradamento dei pacchetti dati. A ciascun nodo collegato alla rete Internet viene assegnato un indirizzo IP univoco che lo rende raggiungibile da qualunque altro dispositivo connesso.Così, tipicamente, a meno di configurazioni che prevedano l'utilizzo della tecnica NAT (Network address translation), il singolo router o il dispositivo mobile nel caso di utilizzo della rete dati dell'operatore di telefonia mobile risultano assegnatari di un indirizzo IP pubblico dinamico (di solito cambia a ogni nuova connessione) oppure statico (non cambia a ogni collegamento) nei formati IPv4 oppure IPv6.La comunicazione tra due dispositivi collegati alla rete Internet è cosa molto semplice perché è lo stesso protocollo IP, noto l'indirizzo pubblico del destinatario, a occuparsi della selezione del percorso migliore per veicolare i dati (instradamento).Il port forwarding è una tecnica che permette di trasferire i pacchetti dati da un sistema all'altro utilizzano una specifica porta di comunicazione.Il già citato TCP e UDP sono protocolli di rete che operano al livello di trasporto: essi si occupano della gestione della procedura di trasferimento dei pacchetti dati utilizzando approcci molto differenti l'uno rispetto all'altro.Corre infatti un'importante differenza tra i protocolli TCP e UDP: il primo è detto connection oriented, il secondo connection-less.",

          "description": "Vim is a powerful command-line code editor tool that’s an enhanced version of the venerable vi editor. Although most people use it with Linux, Vim is compatible with most of the commonly used operating systems, including macOS, Windows, and DOS. \n    \nDespite the abundance of graphical rich text editors, familiarity with Vim will help every user, from an experienced system administrator to a newbie programming a Raspberry Pi. However, one important thing to note when using Vim, is that the function of a key depends on the “mode” the editor is in. For example, pressing the alphabet “j” will move the cursor down one line in the “command mode”. You’ll have to switch to the “insert mode” to make the keys input the character they represent.\n    \nIf you’re new to Vim, open a terminal and run vimtutor to get you started with some initial commands before diving into the rest.\n   \n   \n  \nDownload this Cheatsheet\n Enter your email below to receive this PDF cheatsheet in your Inbox.\n Read more",
