When I boot up the computer, Firefox would usually restore the windows and tabs from the last session. But in the last few days, I am running into a new issue where Firefox doesn't open properly when it tries to restore the windows from the previous session. Here is a screenshot of what it looks like. The black window on the left is supposedly Firefox, but it's not responsive at all. The black is also from the KDE login splash screen (you can kind of see the logo). When I close that window from the task bar and reopen Firefox, it doesn't open any previous tabs, even pinned tabs. Another weird thing is that it logs me out of some sites, such as Reddit, which is weird and leads me to think some local data is getting wiped. This whole issue only happens sometimes, but more often than not and has only started in the last few days.

Yet, every time I have to do something unique, I have to install more packages in the system to make it more complete. What I believed to be a complete installation of Arch Linux 3yrs ago, now I realise is very incomplete.\n And the fact that there are always new things coming. What wasnt possible in linux then is now being possible thanks to many people writing and improving free software to do real work. Means more puzzle pieces you stumble upon to make your system more complete, means there is always more steps to do.\n I think its better related to with the big bang, that thing which initialized the universe. We have a date when it started but not when big bang end. Why? Because it is still going on. Big Bang will end only when the universe ends. Same thing with Arch Linux.

          "description": "Two days ago the wireplumber package was made to replace pipewire-media-session as the latter session manager for PipeWire is considered dead upstream and will see no more releases. Unfortunately, this step was premature.\nOur pipewire audio packages (pipewire-alsa, pipewire-jack and pipewire-pulse) ship configuration that prompt media-session to activate PipeWire's audio features. When these packages are not installed and the configuration is missing, PipeWire can be used for screen recording without interfering with ALSA or PulseAudio.\nWirePlumber disregards this mechanism and always configures PipeWire to grab audio devices, meaning users of PulseAudio or bare ALSA experience broken audio.\nThe replacement has been reverted while we attempt to look for a better solution switching to WirePlumber. If you are currently not using PipeWire for audio and wireplumber got installed on your system, please reinstall pipewire-media-session and reboot to restore audio functionality.\npacman -Syu pipewire-media-session",

Immersive View permette di ottenere una fedele rappresentazione delle principali città del mondo realizzata combinando le informazioni provenienti dagli archivi di Street View con le immagini satellitari e le foto aeree che Google conserva nei suoi server.Il risultato lascia davvero a bocca aperta: la modellazione 3D delle città appare perfetta e l'utente può guardare da qualunque prospettiva effettuando zoom, optando per una vista più panoramica e concentrandosi sulla disposizione di monumenti e punti d'interesse.Il bello è che Immersive View si integra con tutti gli altri strumenti forniti da Google Maps: è quindi possibile visualizzare le informazioni di traffico in tempo reale, la disposizione di negozi, bar, ristoranti e altre attività, accedere agli ambienti interni di tanti locali e così via.Per rendervi conto della portata della novità, date un'occhiata a questo breve video dimostrativo che Google ha diffuso in queste ore.Nella fase di lancio, Immersive View sarà disponibile soltanto per le città di Los Angeles, Londra, New York, San Francisco e Tokyo.",

Il nome utente e la password sono dati insufficienti a garantire elevati standard di sicurezza perché sono facili da sottrarre e possono essere utilizzati da soggetti non autorizzati. Ne abbiamo parlato anche in occasione del World Password Day.Molte applicazioni online chiedono oggi agli utenti di aggiungere un ulteriore livello di sicurezza al proprio account e lo fanno abilitando l'autenticazione a due fattori o 2FA (two factor authentication).Abbiamo visto cos'è l'autenticazione a due fattori e sappiamo che esistono vari metodi per implementarla e utilizzarla, alcuni molto più di sicuri di altri. Ad esempio gli SMS sono meno sicuri nell'ambito di un sistema per l'autenticazione a due fattori: la crescita vorticosa del numero di attacchi SIM swap ne è la conferma.\nCodici OTP: cosa sono\n Acronimo di One-time password, gli OTP sono codici che vengono generati sul dispositivo dell'utente e che sono validi, in combinazione con altri fattori (ad esempio username e password), per autenticarsi e ottenere l'accesso a un sito Web o un servizio online.Sono anche comunemente utilizzati per apporre la firma digitale remota, utile per sottoscrivere documenti digitali così come se vi si fosse applicata la propria firma autografa.Gli OTP sono anche conosciuti come 'password usa e getta' perché restano validi per breve tempo e in ogni caso solo per una singola sessione di accesso o una specifica transazione.I codici OTP vengono generati da parte di apposite app di autenticazione installabili e avviabili su un dispositivo mobile o su un computer.",

Quegli stessi soggetti che si cerca di tutelare.Oggi la Commissione Europea ha annunciato un'ulteriore nuova regolamentazione che mira a proteggere i minori dagli abusi.Anche in questo caso le finalità sono nobili ma le conseguenze degli adempimenti di cui si parla potrebbero rivelarsi estremamente invasivi e pericolosissimi sul piano della tutela della privacy.Stando a quanto proposto in sede europea, le applicazioni di messaggistica istantanea, comprese WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Signal e così via, saranno chiamate ad analizzare selettivamente i messaggi privati degli utenti alla ricerca di materiale pedopornografico e di comportamenti equiparabili ad attività di 'adescamento' di soggetti minorenni.Matthew Green, uno dei più noti e stimati docenti di crittografia, ha condannato senza appello la scelta europea definendo il documento presentato come 'il più terrificante mai visto finora.",

          "description": "As outlined in yesterday's extensive article about NVIDIA's new open-source Linux kernel GPU driver, currently for consumer GeForce RTX GPUs the driver is considered of \"alpha quality\" while NVIDIA's initial focus has been on data center GPU support. In any event with having lots of Turing/Ampere GPUs around, I've been trying out this new open-source Linux kernel driver on the consumer GPUs. In particular, I've been curious about the performance of using this open-source kernel driver relative to the default, existing closed-source kernel driver. Here are some early benchmarks.",

To much excitement and a sign of the times, the embargo has just expired on this super-exciting milestone that many of us have been hoping to see for many years. Over the past two decades NVIDIA has offered great Linux driver support with their proprietary driver stack, but with the success of AMD's open-source driver effort going on for more than a decade, many have been calling for NVIDIA to open up their drivers. Their user-space software is remaining closed-source but as of today they have formally opened up their Linux GPU kernel modules and will be maintaining it moving forward. Here's the scoop on this landmark open-source decision at NVIDIA.",
