          "description": "I have a display manager installed on Arch so that I can conveniently switch between KDE plasma and DWM when needed. On this display manager, there is a gui option to \"hibernate\". Today I accidentally clicked this option, and when I tried to boot my computer back up, I was take directly to my Windows partition without first going to GRUB. I checked my bios(HP laptop) and the grub entry was missing altogether. I went to the bios' boot menu, manually selected the grubx64.efi file from my boot partition, and successfully booted Arch again. Now that my bios doesn't have a grub uefi entry, I need to add it back. I've tried a few things:\n ​\n First, I ran grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg, which resulted in: \n Generating grub configuration file ...\n Found linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-linux\n Found initrd image: /boot/intel-ucode.img /boot/initramfs-linux.img\n Found fallback initrd image(s) in /boot: intel-ucode.img initramfs-linux-fal\n Warning: os-prober will be executed to detect other bootable partitions.\n Its output will be used to detect bootable binaries on them and create new bo\n Found Windows Boot Manager on /dev/nvme0n1p1@/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n Adding boot menu entry for UEFI Firmware Settings ...\n done. However, when I called efibootmgr, it still didn't show the uefi entry.\n Next, I decided to manually create an entry using efibootmgr, so I ran efibootmgr -c -d /dev/nvme0n1p1 -p 7 -L GRUB -l \\EFI\\GRUB\\grubx64.efi, after which efibootmgr showed that there was a new 'GRUB' entry. \n However, when I load back into the bios, there still isn't a GRUB entry, and the only thing there is Windows. Secure boot is disabled. Is there something else I can try?\n    submitted by    /u/zarbod  \n [link]   [comments]",

In short, this is Power management bug with first generation Rayzen Zenmicroarchitecture for the CPU to go to sleep mode yeas you heard it right, the CPU somehow's think the laptop is now on sleep mode like the laptop screen were turned down OFF. \n Looks like with recent Kernel updates this issue were fixed, BTW I want to mention other thing that Archlinux were the only Linux distro that were able to detect my Laptop eMMC internal drive, since HP made it only visible on UEFI shell mode made Windows 10 &11 the only OS function to this laptop, until Arch Linux did the miracle, supporting that new mode, allowing me to enjoy the Linux experience, even when HP support reply to this Laptop supports Windows 10/11 only.\n    submitted by    /u/Hjine  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's currently autologging and starting Steam, with the others set up as shortcuts through Steam, but I would love to give the non-steam software a first-class billing rather than being \"things accessible through steam\".\n Given that they all offer .session files, it seems like the place for a display manager to shine. Unfortunately everything I've used so far puts user selection front and centre (I only ever want one user for normal gameplay purposes), and tend to hide session selection in a small, mouse-only menu.\n Are there any display managers or greeters out there that prioritise Session selection?

          "description": "I'm new to Linux and for the past week, I've been trying to use bspwm and polybar. I'm trying to customize the workspaces of my polybar so I can add icons to them, but I've noticed that the default polybar script from the official github page does not contain a bspwm module anymore, which means that a big part of customization is left out. What is there that I can do to still be able to customize my workspaces and add icons there? I've also followed a tutorial where this YouTuber lets you use his polybar script, but I'm also having issues with that as the fonts and icons won't load. Is there anyone who would like to help me configure a polybar? I've spent days going at this with not much success so far. Thank you in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/TotalLanky5773  \n [link]   [comments]",

All of a sudden, when I tried to boot Arch, by the time LightDM should appear, the screen goes black (no keyboard cursor, not even back-lighting) and the computer goes silent. As if the computer turned off, but it is still on. The only way to turn it off is to hold the power button.\n What could be the issue? I haven't seen any similar issue online. The only thing that comes to mind is something regarding hibernate mode not working properly, but that still doesn't make much sense.\n EDIT: after a couple restarts it started working normally for some reason, but I know that it's very dangerous to hold the power button, so I guess this is still relevant.\n    submitted by    /u/abstract-anxiety  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Android 13, ovvero la nuova major release del sistema operativo, sarà senza dubbio protagonista dell'evento Google I/O che si svolgerà l'11-12 maggio prossimi. Come abbiamo visto negli anni precedenti, tuttavia, il fatto che Android sarà ovviamente al centro del palcoscenico non esclude che Google non abbia qualche sorpresa in serbo.Durante la Google I/O 2021 la società di Mountain View ha presentato l'importante aggiornamento di Wear OS confermando l'interesse per il settore dei dispositivi indossabili. A contribuire al rinnovamento ci ha pensato Samsung che con Google ha impostato una collaborazione incentrata proprio sugli indossabili e su Wear OS.La novità di quest'anno potrebbe essere Android TV 13, sistema operativo destinato alle smart TV di nuova generazione e ai dispositivi multimediali 'da salotto' come TV box e similari.Dopo la resurrezione di Wear OS e i primi passi di Android L, versione specifica di Android per i dispositivi dotati di display più ampio, Google sta ora preparando qualcosa di nuovo per le TV, un altro settore in cui ha mostrato un interesse limitato negli ultimi tempi.Android TV 13 introdurrà miglioramenti relativi all'efficienza energetica e una serie di novità volte a limitare il numero delle notifiche presentate così da impedire il 'risveglio' del dispositivo quando in 'modalità sleep'.",

          "description": "I ricercatori di ESET hanno annunciato di aver scoperto diverse vulnerabilità nel firmware Lenovo che potrebbero essere sfruttate da parte di aggressori e criminali informatici per caricare codice arbitrario a ogni avvio del sistema rendendolo peraltro più difficile da individuare e complesso da rimuovere.Lenovo ha confermato che il problema riguarda almeno 100 modelli dei suoi notebook e invita gli utenti a installare tempestivamente gli aggiornamenti correttivi.Sono complessivamente tre le lacune di sicurezza venute a galla: esse permettono a un aggressore disattivare la protezione a livello del chip flash SPI dove è memorizzato il codice del BIOS UEFI e ad esempio di disattivare la funzionalità Secure Boot.Lo sfruttamento di una delle tre vulnerabilità (CVE-2021-3970) consente a un aggressore locale di eseguire codice arbitrario con privilegi elevati.Due delle tre problematiche individuate da ESET sono la conseguenza dell'erronea introduzione nel firmware reso pubblico di due driver, chiamati SecureBackDoor e SecureBackDoorPeim, che avrebbero dovuto restare all'interno della struttura di Lenovo perché adoperati con finalità di sviluppo e test.Una lista completa dei modelli di notebook Lenovo interessati dal problema di sicurezza è stata pubblicata in questa pagina.Come spesso ricordato, vulnerabilità simili a quelle trovate da ESET sono particolarmente pericolose perché permettono di abilitare il caricamento di codice che viene elaborato prima dell'avvio del sistema operativo.Certo, l'individuazione del codice malevolo è possibile verificando l'integrità del firmware UEFI, esaminandolo in tempo reale e monitorandone il comportamento per far emergere eventuali attività sospette.",

Superate le problematiche residue che ne avevano impedito la distribuzione su vasta scala, da metà aprile 2022 Windows Update ha cominciato a proporre l'installazione di Windows 10 21H2 all'intera base di utenti. Come spiega Microsoft possono esservi delle eccezioni, sempre ricollegabili a problematiche hardware e software, ma il feature update più recente fa adesso la sua comparsa sulla totalità o quasi delle macchine Windows 10.Ricordiamo che l'aggiornamento resta opzionale fintanto che la versione di Windows 10 non si avvicina alla data di fine del supporto: premere Windows+R, digitare winver, cercare il numero della versione di Windows 10 installata all'interno di questa pagina quindi controllare la data riportata nelle colonne Fine del servizio (a seconda dell'edizione).Con l'applicazione InControl o comunque con un intervento diretto a livello di registro di sistema si può evitare l'aggiornamento di Windows e fare in modo che Windows Update non proponga neppure il passaggio a Windows 11.Per aggiornare a Windows 10 21H2 partendo da una precedente versione del sistema operativo si può usare anche il Media Creation Tool in alternativa a Windows Update.",

          "description": "C'è stato un momento in passato in cui tanti utenti sentivano il bisogno di acquisire massimi privilegi sul loro dispositivo Android. Abbiamo già spiegato cos'è il root Android e come funziona. Oggi sono molti meno gli utenti che effettuano il root su Android: ciò è dovuto al fatto che Google aggiunge periodicamente nuove funzionalità al sistema operativo e che alcune applicazioni (si pensi ad esempio a quelle per lo streaming di contenuti o per l'accesso ai servizi di online banking) non si avviano sui dispositivi 'rootati'.Un'applicazione open source come Shizuku è destinata ai palati più fini e permette di acquisire privilegi più elevati su Android senza sottoporre a root il dispositivo.Come spiegato nella home page del progetto su GitHub, Shizuku utilizza un'intelligente trucchetto per attivare funzionalità root-like sui dispositivi Android: l'uso dell'interfaccia di ADB (Android Debug Bridge) combinato con le API di sistema consente di applicare modifiche diversamente impossibili.Shizuku si pone a metà strada tra le singole applicazioni e i servizi di sistema riuscendo a sfruttare le API che intervengono a basso livello.Tante applicazioni che di norma su Android richiedono i permessi di root stanno via via ampliando il supporto a Shizuku: selezionando la voce Shizuku durante la configurazione, si possono usare le funzionalità più evolute senza effettuare il rooting del dispositivo mobile.Gli autori di Shizuku forniscono pubblicamente le indicazioni sulle chiamate che gli sviluppatori Android possono inserire nelle loro app per sfruttare i benefici dell'applicazione e acquisire privilegi più elevati anche senza root.",
