          "description": "Hi,\n months ago I have installed arch on my previous laptop's ssd and have been using it in an ssd enclosure as an external ssd alongside my laptop which has Windows in its internal ssd. Because my laptop happens to have two ssd slots (one of which is unoccupied) I wanted to take the arch ssd out of the enclosure and into my laptops second ssd slot. My expectation is to use both windows and arch in a dual-boot manner but without the disadvantages of dual-boot (two seperate ssd's: lesser chance of things going wrong, not tight on space, etc.). \n Yesterday I have opened up my laptop for the first time and installed the arch ssd into the empty slot and put the laptop back together. When I start the laptop, I can choose between arch and windows but when I boot arch, the following error occurs: \n \"ERROR: device ‘UUID=<device\\_uuid>’ not found. Skipping fsck\"\n I know that this error is occuring because the UUID is different now that it is in an ssd slot instead of being connected by USB. So, naturally I have to somehow edit the UUID that the OS searches for when booting. But I just couldn't figure out how to and was unsuccessful with finding similar cases in the internet forums. \n As a result, I'm here, asking for your help.\n    submitted by    /u/Free_Transition_4746  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think I simply chose the wrong /boot partition before.\n But the thing is that it still takes a long time to boot Arch.\n After selecting it in Grub, it stays on a black screen with the text on the top left:\n Starting version 251.3-1-arch \n And then, after a good wait, it brings up the following lines:\n [ TIME ] Timed out waiting for device /dev/disk/by-uuid/31fe4ea4-003c-4c31-947c-88874131ccd3.

Il processore top di gamma potrebbe essere l'Intel Core i9-13900K, del quale si parla già da tempo, e i nuovi arrivati nel catalogo Intel avranno il compito di continuare sulla buona strada imboccata con gli Alder Lake raccogliendone l'eredità.I core ad alta efficienza dei processori Intel Raptor Lake manterranno  invece l'architettura Gracemont: solo i core più performanti saranno forieri quindi di miglioramenti a livello di IPC.\n\nNuove 'voci di corridoio' pongono quasi sullo stesso piano i nuovi core Raptor Cove con gli attuali Golden Cove (architettura dei core ad alte prestazioni usata negli Alder Lake) presentandoli sì come una versione migliorata ma, tutto sommato, come un aggiornamento minore.",

Direttamente interessata è quindi la produzione di SoC per dispositivi intelligenti, Chromebook e tablet.

Di seguito presentiamo alcuni semplici trucchi per aprire cartelle in Windows e passare dall'una all'altra molto semplicemente senza usare utilità (file manager) di terze parti.\nDifferenza tra cartelle e directory\n I termini cartella e directory sono generalmente intercambiabili.Il nome 'directory' è quello più classico perché si utilizzava anche prima dell'arrivo sul mercato dei sistemi operativi dotati di interfaccia grafica. Una directory viene infatti considerata come un oggetto a livello di file system.Viceversa una cartella è un oggetto che è parte integrante dell'interfaccia utente o GUI del sistema operativo: l'utilizzo di questo termine è storicamente più familiare agli utenti di Windows.\nAprire cartelle Windows velocemente\n Per aprire una cartella Windows in modo rapido si può usare un semplice trucco che noi usiamo comunemente.Utilizzando la combinazione di tasti Windows+R compare la finestra di dialogo Esegui.Iniziando a digitare un percorso a partire dall'unità (ad esempio C:\\), Windows propone la lista delle varie sottocartelle presenti.\n\nSi può scegliere un percorso tra quelli proposti: non appena si digita la barra rovesciata finale ( \\ ), Windows indica quali sottocartelle sono presenti.",
