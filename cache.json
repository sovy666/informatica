The only real problem I'm having (- other than non-latin characters not showing up correctly) is that I'm not able to make any edits to files within musicbee as every time I try to eg, like a song, export a playlist etc, I get the error 'Sharing violation. This file cannot be updated as another application has this file open at the same time'. \n Checking fuser on the files in question show that they are used by 'MusicBee.exe' and 'wineserver', probably meaning that wineserver is what's causing musicbee to lock up on making these edits. Anyone know of a fix for this?\n  \nOnly, the music is on my Linux Mint, ext4 drive, so I'm not sure what is happening.

It was meant initially as a \"personal use\" script I made mainly because I hated being forced to open LibreOffice (with its RAM usage and bloaty buttons) every time I needed to see the content of a doc file. I uploaded the script on github in case anyone needed a similiar thing, then just forgot about it.\n Then few days ago, checking github after a long time, I discovered that many people adopted it and even made some patches. Also I discovered that a person of good will created and maintained the related AUR package, named zaread-git.\n So, moved by the sense of guilt of my disappearing, I checked the pull requests made in the years, reordered the code, fixed some bugs I discovered and committed on github. Then I reported the updates in its AUR page. The problem is that the creator of zaread-git AUR package is not an Arch user anymore and asks for a new maintainer.\n Now I feel the responsability of maintaining it, my problem is that, despite being a >10 years Arch user... I never did it before. To me AUR packages always have been one of those \"magic\" things the computer does to simplify your work.I would like to give to it a mandatory dependency (zathura) and some optional dependencies (libreoffice, calibre, md2pdf).\n Does anyone know if there are tutorials that explain how to start from scratch? I know that there is an helper (clean-chroot-manager) but its man page is a bit thin.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/paoloap  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's the first time I'm tinkering with Intel APU stuff so I don't even know what I'm really dealing with. Also, the point that the issue is also visible in the tty confuses me.\n Edit: I was able to get the issue fixed now! Thank you so much to /u/w0330 for pointing the solution out. Everything works like a charm now, in tty and KDE.\n i915.enable_psr=0 as kernel parameter was the correct solution but somehow it didn't work in the beginning, I guess because I messed something up.\n If you encounter the same issue using Intel Iris Xe graphics, try setting the given parameter, don't use xf86-video-intel and don't provide any additional launch information for xorg.\n    submitted by    /u/ViaRegia95  \n [link]   [comments]",

Uninstalling apps is easy enough: simply go to the Apps list, find the app, and hit the Uninstall button. But it’s not so easy to completely uninstall apps on Android.\n    \nUnfortunately, for those who like a clean file system, some apps will leave behind “orphaned files” after uninstallation on Android devices. These files were created by the app so that it can do its job if they weren’t properly deleted after the app was uninstalled. This can get annoying when your device’s system is slowly clogged up by files and folders that aren’t being used. The solution then is to find a way to reliably remove leftover app data.\n   \n\nContent\n\nManual Clean\nDeleting Folders\nConnect to a Computer\nSD Maid\nES File Explorer\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n.toc{background-color:#f3f4f6;font-size:16px;font-weight:500;padding:1em;}.toc h4{text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase;font-size:0.9375rem;margin-bottom:1rem;}.toc ul{margin:0;padding:0;font-size:15px;}.toc-content{overflow-y:auto;max-height:600px;}.toc-content li{list-style:none!important;margin-bottom:1em;}.toc-content a{color:rgba(74,85,104,var(--text-opacity));text-decoration:none;}.toc-content a:hover{color:#C72F29;}.toc-content li.active a{color:#C72F29;font-weight:bold;}@media (min-width:1340px){.toc-wrap{position:absolute;float:left;margin-left:-9rem;top:0;left:-90px;height:100%;width:200px;background-color:white;}.toc{position:sticky;top:50px;font-size:14px;padding:0.5em;}.toc-content li{margin-bottom:0.5em;}}   \nAlso read:Read more",
