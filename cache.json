As a result, I now have no internet in Arch, I can't install it within arch because I need internet to install a package (catch 22). After looking around, I found that I could chroot into arch from my USB boot which had internet and then use Pacstrap to install netctl.

          "description": "I really like the idea of arch. The appeal to me is probably the same appeal to everyone else: complete customizeability, community-driven, fun to tinker with, etc.\n But I'm very much new to the Linux world and don't really know what sort of things Arch does that other don't, nor what I'm giving up by going Arch over other distributions.\n For example, I play League of Legends. The traditional way of getting League on Linux is through Play On Linux with a special Wine version. Is that something that's doable on Arch?\n Are all Proton Steam games available on Arch in a streamlined/easy way? Meaning, I just install steam, select the \"proton experimental\" button and suddenly I can download Apex Legends? Or are there more steps?\n Are there any difficulties with peripherals? Is my mouse/headset/Blue Yeti going to work easily?\n In short, am I giving up any software accessibility by going Arch or is everything that's available on other Linux distributions mostly available on Arch?\n And how difficult is the installation process *truly*? I get that it's supposedly difficult, but is it so difficult that even following a guide wouldn't be sufficient to get it installed correctly the first time?\n Thanks!\n ​\n Strong edit for some things I want to do on Linux:\n  \nPlay League of Legends/Battle.net games/Steam Proton games.\n Install i3 Window Tiling Manager\n Custom keybinds\n Install Unreal Engine\n Vim\n  \n​\n    submitted by    /u/mushroomgambit  \n [link]   [comments]",

Only firefox and vim as additional packages.\n Install went smooth, no errors. I rebooted and instead of finding myself on a bare minimum login screen I was on a command line asking for my user and password.\n I though that the minimum install would give me a desktop environment so I just though that I should reboot and reinstall with kde as an aditional package and I would be golden.\n That's when things went wrong.\n Firstly the bios refused to show up, the pc was dead. I tried reseting a few times while waiting a few minutes and nothing.\n Then out of nowhere, while doing some research of my phone on what I might have done wrong the bios showed up. The install must have done something weird to my sistem so I tried booting on the flashdrive again so I could reinstall Arch and try checking what I've done wrong.\n But it is soooo, sloooow, like, it takes minutes to leave the boot screen. Right now I've been waiting for the flashdrive to boot, it's so slow that I can't tell if it's worlking or stuck. When I press delete it instantle goes to the bios config screen so it is still respondive.\n Edit: I was able to get to the install again by restoring default bios config and booting the flash drive. Do you guys have any idea of what's going on? I might have made a mistake while configuring the disk layout, I'm having a hard time making heads or tailsof whats going on in the install, so my plan is to let it do what it want on the drive I want the system to be, and set the rest on a graphical interface later.\n    submitted by    /u/GreenRiot  \n [link]   [comments]",

Using Ubuntu was freeing but it also felt like I didn't really get what was going on under the surface because I didn't really have a hand to play in any of it.\n So that's a really long-winded way to start this post but my main question for you all is - what could Gentoo teach me?

When I boot up the computer, Firefox would usually restore the windows and tabs from the last session. But in the last few days, I am running into a new issue where Firefox doesn't open properly when it tries to restore the windows from the previous session. Here is a screenshot of what it looks like. The black window on the left is supposedly Firefox, but it's not responsive at all. The black is also from the KDE login splash screen (you can kind of see the logo). When I close that window from the task bar and reopen Firefox, it doesn't open any previous tabs, even pinned tabs. Another weird thing is that it logs me out of some sites, such as Reddit, which is weird and leads me to think some local data is getting wiped. This whole issue only happens sometimes, but more often than not and has only started in the last few days.

Yet, every time I have to do something unique, I have to install more packages in the system to make it more complete. What I believed to be a complete installation of Arch Linux 3yrs ago, now I realise is very incomplete.\n And the fact that there are always new things coming. What wasnt possible in linux then is now being possible thanks to many people writing and improving free software to do real work. Means more puzzle pieces you stumble upon to make your system more complete, means there is always more steps to do.\n I think its better related to with the big bang, that thing which initialized the universe. We have a date when it started but not when big bang end. Why? Because it is still going on. Big Bang will end only when the universe ends. Same thing with Arch Linux.

When I wake it up password field is write protected ( basically i can't type anything in it ), and it's not keyboard fault because when click CapsLock it notifies me about clicking it, and also i can get to tty. My display manager is Lightdm with gtk greeter and my DE is xfce4. Also I think that this started happening after I installed deepin DE for fun and then removed it. If anyone knew how I could tell me how I could fix it I would be grateful.\n    submitted by    /u/Kuba_CXD  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "author": "Jan Alexander Steffens",
          "description": "Two days ago the wireplumber package was made to replace pipewire-media-session as the latter session manager for PipeWire is considered dead upstream and will see no more releases. Unfortunately, this step was premature.\nOur pipewire audio packages (pipewire-alsa, pipewire-jack and pipewire-pulse) ship configuration that prompt media-session to activate PipeWire's audio features. When these packages are not installed and the configuration is missing, PipeWire can be used for screen recording without interfering with ALSA or PulseAudio.\nWirePlumber disregards this mechanism and always configures PipeWire to grab audio devices, meaning users of PulseAudio or bare ALSA experience broken audio.\nThe replacement has been reverted while we attempt to look for a better solution switching to WirePlumber. If you are currently not using PipeWire for audio and wireplumber got installed on your system, please reinstall pipewire-media-session and reboot to restore audio functionality.\npacman -Syu pipewire-media-session",

L'anno seguente un gruppo di criminali informatici riuscì a sostituire la versione originale dell'applicazione con una dannosa agendo sui server dell'azienda e nel 2020 destò scalpore la raccolta di dati effettuata senza il consenso degli utenti.Da allora Piriform assunse un impegno preciso e spiegò che avrebbe risolto ogni problematica in sospeso cercando di riguadagnare la fiducia degli utenti.Dopo i precedenti 'scivoloni', CCleaner è tornato un software decisamente più affidabile anche se la mancata condivisione del codice sorgente (non è un progetto open source) resta un problema per molti utenti.CCleaner 6.0 è l'ultima versione del software che Piriform ha appena iniziato a distribuire attraverso i suoi server: l'abbiamo provata e al momento non viene proposta l'installazione di alcun software aggiuntivo o potenzialmente inutile come accaduto in passato e come segnalava lo stesso Microsoft Defender.",

In un altro articolo abbiamo descritto le principali novità di Windows 11 22H2.Microsoft sta però già guardando oltre e se le funzionalità di Windows 11 22H2 sono ormai 'congelate' adesso si comincia a parlare delle innovazioni che verranno introdotte in tempi successivi.In una nota pubblicata sul blog ufficiale dell'azienda, Amanda Langowski e Brandon LeBlanc hanno presentato Azioni suggerite o Suggested actions in inglese.Si tratta di una funzionalità attiva a livello di sistema che consente di riconoscere le informazioni selezionate con il cursore o il puntatore del mouse o del touchpad.Si supponga di evidenziare un numero di telefono: Windows 11 lo riconoscerà e permetterà di chiamarlo usando le applicazioni supportate oppure di aggiungerlo in rubrica.\n\nStessa cosa per date e orari: selezionandoli il sistema operativo chiederà all'utente se aggiungere un'attività nel calendario, avviare una pianificazione con Outlook oppure con altre applicazioni compatibili.Al momento le Azioni suggerite possono essere provate solo dagli utenti statunitensi iscritti al canale Dev del programma Windows Insider di Windows 11.",

          "description": "Quando si devono coprire con il segnale WiFi aree piuttosto vaste l'approccio migliore è certamente quello di orientarsi su sistemi mesh che consentono di spostarsi da un ambiente all'altro con i dispositivi client (notebook, convertibili, smartphone, tablet,...) senza disconnessioni rilevabili.Le WiFi mesh sono la migliore risposta alle esigenze di copertura di chi ha la necessità di creare una rete WiFi domestica o professionale.Nell'articolo citato in apertura abbiamo comunque evidenziato su quali aspetti è importante concentrare la propria attenzione e soprattutto sull'importanza del backhauling ovvero del collegamento (wireless o cablato, con cavo Ethernet) tra i nodi del sistema WiFi e il router principale.I sistemi WiFi mesh, tuttavia, sono piuttosto costosi e una delle domande più ricorrenti tra gli utenti è la seguente: è possibile usare lo stesso SSID su più router e access point, anche di diversi produttori, senza orientarsi su una soluzione mesh? Proviamo a rispondere.\nSSID, cos'è e a cosa serve\n Acronimo di Service Set IDentifier, SSID è l'identificativo che viene assegnato a ciascuna rete WiFi: è un nome arbitrario che rende riconoscibile la rete e semplifica il collegamento dei client wireless.Una volta stabilita la connessione con un router o un access point che utilizza un certo SSID, il client WiFi proverà successivamente a ricollegarsi alle reti wireless note usando i parametri di accesso precedentemente impostati: ad esempio la password utilizzata a protezione della rete WiFi e l'algoritmo configurato (i.e.",

Basti pensare che essi coniugano l'utilizzo di un sensore fotografico principale da ben 108 Megapixel, l'eventuale supporto per la connessione alle reti mobili 5G con un prezzo che non arriva a 300 euro.Nonostante i due Realme 9 siano 'varianti' del medesimo dispositivo, le differenze tra i modelli 4G e 5G sono notevoli se si esaminano le specifiche tecniche: ciò si riflette sul prezzo finale. È curioso, ad esempio, che alla fine è il Realme 9 4G a vantare i componenti hardware più potenti montando ad esempio un sensore Samsung HM6 da 108 Megapixel, un obiettivo ultra grandangolare, un display da 6,4 pollici Super AMOLED (FHD+ 2.400 x 1.080 pixel 90 Hz) e un SoC Snapdragon 680 accompagnato da 64 o 128 GB di storage interno.

Un prodotto caricato di enormi aspettative che però non ha mai raggiunto il mercato di massa. E forse non tanto perché non vi fosse interesse ma perché i Google Glass sono rimasti un dispositivo piuttosto costoso, riservato soltanto al mercato professionale e delle imprese.In occasione della Google I/O 2022 l'azienda di Mountain View ha confermato che l'idea di realizzare occhiali smart basati sulla realtà aumentata non è tramontata.I portavoce di Google hanno mostrato un breve video che descrive un prototipo di occhiali in grado di abbattere le barriere linguistiche e consentire la traduzione in tempo reale. In altre parole chi indossa i nuovi occhiali Google può leggere la trascrizione istantanea del parlato tradotta nella propria lingua mentre sta guardando negli occhi il suo interlocutore.\n\nCome si vede nell'immagine, il software degli occhiali Google rileva automaticamente che l'altra persona sta parlando in inglese quindi traduce le sue parole nella lingua conosciuta da chi indossa il dispositivo smart.Come si vede, almeno allo stato attuale, non si tratta affatto di una nuova versione dei Google Glass.",

In any event with having lots of Turing/Ampere GPUs around, I've been trying out this new open-source Linux kernel driver on the consumer GPUs. In particular, I've been curious about the performance of using this open-source kernel driver relative to the default, existing closed-source kernel driver. Here are some early benchmarks.",
