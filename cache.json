When i tried to run it my monitors went black with an \"out of range\" message on it and it persists after rebooting. The SDDM animation displays as normal on boot but then when I'd normally get to the KDE desktop i get the black screens again. I was able to hear Firefox start playing a video due to random luck pressing buttons during the black screen, so i'm sure its running I think its just stuck in a display setting that isn't working.\n I've tried editing the kernel parameters and adding nomodeset, also tried specifying the resolution and refresh rate of my monitor there and it doesn't help. I've tried unplugging and plugging the monitors, booting with just one monitor connected, none of it has made a difference. Any suggestions on how to get back to my desktop? I'm using systemdboot and X11 if that makes any difference. Thanks.\n Edit: Finally fixed it. Booted with the kernel parameter 3 in order to boot to the command line and deleted everything in ~/.local/share/kscreen\n Now working after a reboot.\n    submitted by    /u/Mojo_Ryzen  \n [link]   [comments]",

That said, it may not be an Arch problem at all, but I had to start somewhere.\n ‚Äã\n The problem is that Firefox freezes frequently, and for sevaral seconds at a time, on one of my PCs. Active tab is frozen, and can't switch to any other. After several seconds a tab responds, and makes FF essentially useless. This happens only on one machine.\n ‚Äã\n I run Firefox on KDE. I have three instances:\n - Arch vfio VM w/nvidia\n - Fedora Spin vfio VM with custom repo for kde latest, w/nvidia\n - Arch on System76 laptop w/intel/nvida, using Optimus Manager in hybrid mode\n ‚Äã\n The two VMs are configured the same with all respects except for OS. I only run one or the other at a time. There are no tweaks applied to Firefox on any instance other than add-ons.\n ‚Äã\n The VMs are my daily drivers, and ideally it would be the Arch VM. But since Firefox is unusable essentially on that VM,I am using Fedora until I can solve this problem.\n ‚Äã\n Things that I have tried on the Arch VM:\n - reviewed the Arch Wiki entry for solutions\n - Safe mode\n - clear clache\n - move cache to ramdisk\n - create new profile\n - Remove FF and ~/.mozilla and /.cache/mozilla directories, reinstall and create a, new profile.\n After each of these changes, the freezing problem always returned at some point.\n ‚Äã\n I am out of ideas.

Also sometimes getting RO filesystem type crashes that may or may not be related.\n I've been doing the following:\n journalctl -b -r -p 1..4 > errors.md and looking for an insertion point for troubleshooting, but it's hard to say what is critical and what isn't without some deeper knowledge of how the kernel is working / supposed to work.\n Dell Precision 5550 only has USB-C inputs and most of the errors are not reproducible in some way that lends itself to easy diagnostics. I updated the BIOS last week and everything is up to date, but the crashes persist and instability persists, especially when there are devices connected to the USB-C ports.\n Is there somewhere else to look or something to be done before I just RMA the machine and use a desktop instead? Really some description of the process is what I'm looking for more than just \"the answer\", which I'm happy to put in the foot miles to get. I'll put the output of the journal log in the comments.\n I would think it was something I'm doing wrong except these problems sometimes happen during POST and I get multiple sequential reboots even before drive decrypt which makes me think I've got a hardware/firmware problem.\n    submitted by    /u/dream_weasel  \n [link]   [comments]",

La soluzione proposta da Manhattan permette una connessione diretta, ordinata e professionale tra dispositivi ed √® quindi ideale per l'home office, l'home theater e per qualunque situazione in cui vi sia l'esigenza di trasferire il segnale audio-video in modo semplice e veloce.Disponibile nelle lunghezze da 1 metro (modello IUSBC-HDMI-4-010) e da 2 metri (modello IUSBC-HDMI-4-020), il cavo adattatore da USB-C a HDMI di Manhattan supporta risoluzioni UHD (Ultra High-Definition) fino a 4K (3840 x 2160 pixel) a 60 Hz garantendo immagini ultra nitide e realistiche, senza sfocature o artefatti, con una qualit√† audio e video eccellenti.\n\nIl versatile adattatore proposto da Manhattan √® compatibile con qualsiasi dispositivo USB-C che supporta la funzionalit√† DisplayPort Alt Mode inclusi smartphone, Apple MacBook, Chromebook, Pixel e tablet.A differenza della maggior parte degli altri cavi DP Alt Mode che supportano solo 30 fps, il prodotto di Manhattan assicura prestazioni ai massimi livelli permettendo di gestire un frame rate fino a 60 fps, ideale quindi anche per il segmento gaming.La circuiteria utilizzata per il cavo adattatore √® compatibile con la tecnologia Thunderbolt 3 e si mette in evidenza per la struttura a doppia schermatura a lamina e treccia in grado di ridurre al minimo le interferenze elettromagnetiche (EMI) cos√¨ come tutte le altre fonti di interferenza.",
