Theme changer from light to dark isn't working either.\n - I try launching Gnome Tweaks from the Gnome Launche but it doesn't launch anything.\n - I go back to the Terminal to at least enlarge the font, however the 'Custom font' checkbox isn't working at all, despite being clickable.\n - I try to document all of this for a friend but the Gnome recorder (CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+R) stops recording at random in the first 10 seconds\n - Trying to \"Pin to dash\" Terminal doesn't actually pin anything\n Nothing of this is important but sets the mood for everything else, pretty much leaves me wondering what else could be broken and made me instantly drop my idea about switching to Arch in my main rig.

Yet, now in the next day, I can enter the grub, yes, but after selecting to boot Arch (be it the Linux Kernel or the Linux-Zen one) and it seems to load normally but then it simply remains pitch black. And no, it's not just the graphical user interface, I can't bring the terminal up either.\n So, I tried using my installation media on a stick to repair, but weirdly it doesn't seem to boot either. I can select it from the boot menu on the bios, and it does boot into the \"options\" (install UEFI, install UEFI with voice, RAM etc.) but it doesn't matter what I select, it too seems to fail to boot.\n I am no \"arch newbie\", been using it for a year or so now, but I am really lost here, I suspect (but I hope it's not) something hardware-related at this point\n EDIT: Update, was able to enter the installation media by booting it on legacy mode and using the load into RAM option\n EDIT2: Ok, was able to chroot by doing so, updated the system once again via sudo pacman -Syu something with a package called libvterm broke but now it's fixed.
