With almost 400 packages while I actively use approximately only about half of this number responding to \"b0rked\", \"needs update\" requests is less fun than one could imagine. Of course I could simply disown all I no longer use but I would like to take more responsible approach - see if I can get anybody else interested, add as a co-maintainer and then if it works well for some period of time step down. If you want to know if you use any of the PKGBUILDs I maintain you can run the following snippet in bash (aurutils, jq required):\n pacman -Qq | grep -xf <((aur search -r -m jose1711 | jq -r '.results|.[].Name')) \n If you're interested in anything, please leave me a message at https://aur.archlinux.org/account/jose1711.

The program itself is not very complicated to install, just a single Python script to copy into a directory.\n Prior in generating the package, I have to update the checksum in PKGBUILD, upload the current state of the project to Github, create a release with a tag and change the version in the PKGBUILD file. Then I can use makepkg to build the package and upload it too in the release tab. Then one can download the \"tochd-x.x-x-any.pkg.tar.zst\" package from release page and install using pacman.\n Am I doing this right? The program itself is working correctly and I tested it by installing it myself (obviously). Just a note here about the program itself: It is more or less a commandline interface to automate extraction archives with 7z and convert certain types of files (such as .iso or .cue) with chdman.

The problem seemingly came out of nowhere, as I hadn't done an update in a couple weeks, and I haven't been able to figure out what might be going on. The issue seems random, and I'll generally get a crash once every day or two, as long as I'm home and using my equipment like normal. Copy of this morning's errors is here.\n Things I've tried:\n -Rolling back all recently installed updates to previous versions from cache\n -Completely disabling C6 states on the processor (Ryzen 5 3400G)\n -Running Memtest to check for errors (none found in 4 passes)\n -Checking disks for critical errors (simple nvme tests for the M.2 drive, and smarttest for the normal disk drives).\n -Moving to linux-zen kernel from linux-lts (this actually led to more frequent issues, so I've since moved back)\n -Added \"blacklist sp5100-tco\" to kernel parameters (I read some threads that indicated a compatibility issue with Ryzen on this)\n -Update all packages to most recent versions (this was my last-ditch effort after everything else had failed me)\n I'm still hitting problems, and outside of it being a hardware issue I'm not properly identifying (I've considered switching the PSU for another good one I have here), I'm at a loss. I've had this headless installation up and running for years. Only once before did I ever encounter a struggle like this, but it was fixed by moving off the arch linux kernel and installing linux-lts. Any help/guidance you might have is appreciated. For what it's worth, I was out of town for the 4th from Friday until Monday, and the server ran the whole time with no problems. Crashed this morning for the first time since we got back, so it appears to almost certainly be tied to usage in some way.\n Edit: Current kernel is 5.15.50-1-lts, running on the AM4 platform with a Ryzen 5 3400G.

What can I do now to restore my backup on the new 140GB partition? Do I need to reinstall arch using a live usb first, then backing up after the full install is done?

While booting an error flashes on the screen among all the other boot text saying \"failed to start load kernel modules\". Using the iso to chroot into the system allows me to disable gdm.service, which fixes it - but then we're back at square one. \n Nvidia drivers are definitely installed so I doubt that's causing it, however the laptop also has an integrated gpu from the intel chip, so I have no way of knowing which one it's even using.\n Any help would be greatly appreciated, kinda losing hope.

Now the partition is expanded, but the EFI file system hasn't changed size and still only shows as the Windows default of 100MB free. How can I change that?\n Edit: Fixed! Evidently, there's a \"bug\" with Gparted making it so that small partitions can't be resized properly - https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=649324.\n I roughly followed the steps in comment 4 of the bug to get the EFI file system expanded.\n My steps:\n  \nBack up contents of /boot - I did # dd if=/dev/nvme0n1p1 of=/backup/nvme0n1p1.img then # cp -r /boot ~/boot-backup.\n Re-format the EFI partition to EXT4 - # mkfs.ext4 /dev/nvme0n1p1.\n Re-size the newly-created EXT4 partition to the correct size - for my scenario, I opened Gparted and ran the \"check\" function on the new EXT4 partition. (I'm not sure if this step was necessary but whatever).\n Reformat the partition back to FAT32 - # mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/nvme0n1p1.\n Restore the EFI partition files from the backup - # cp -r ~/boot-backup/* /boot\n  \nPossibly required steps in no particular order\n  \nModify /etc/fstab for the new PARTUUID of the EFI partition\n Modify bootloader to check the correct partition - I use rEFInd so I had to edit the volumefield in my Arch configuration stanza to the new PARTUUID. \n  \nAfter that, everything seems to be working but I still have the original backup created with dd for now in case I messed something up that I haven't noticed yet.\n If you need to restore the original partition - # dd if=/backup/nvme0n1p1.img of=/dev/nvme0n1p1 which (I think) should restore the entire original partition to how it was.\n I'd probably keep a flash drive with ARCHISO on-hand if you need to do this, but YMMV.\n EDIT2: Evidently, the Arch fatresize package may be able to do the same thing without copying the partition around... so maybe try that first.\n    submitted by    /u/NormGreen  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Da tempo il legislatore europeo stava lavorando per modificare quella che viene considerata come una situazione di squilibrio a favore delle aziende più importanti come Google, Apple e Facebook-Meta. Sono due i pilastri sui quali si sta basando l'azione in campo europeo: Digital Services Act (DSA) e Digital Markets Act (DMA). Entrambi prevedono una serie di restrizioni che mirano a frenare comportamenti anticoncorrenziali e un utilizzo troppo ampio dei dati personali degli utenti.I due nuovi pacchetti di normative sono stati appena approvati dal Parlamento europeo aprendo così la strada al 'via libera' definitivo da parte del Consiglio dell'Unione.Abbiamo già visto cos'è e cosa cambia con la Legge sui Servizi Digitali (DSA) e come DMA possa avere effetto sul funzionamento delle app di messaggistica istantanea.Nel complesso, però, le nuove disposizioni introducono la figura del gatekeeper: esso corrisponde ai soggetti che gestiscono le piattaforme che tutti conosciamo e usiamo ogni giorno.Gestori di store online come Google Play Store ed Apple Store devono accettare e consentire l'installazione di app da altre sorgenti, permettere agli sviluppatori di servirsi di strumenti di pagamento di terze parti nelle rispettive app, consentire il download e l'installazione di file binari da Internet, l'integrazione di applicazioni e servizi digitali con quelli del gatekeeper.Servizi di messaggistica istantanea, quelli per le chiamate vocali e le videochiamate devono quindi, a norma di legge, essere integrabili reciprocamente.",

Nel 1981 nasceva il primo storico PC IBM 5150: i modelli presentati da Big Blue in precedenza non potevano essere considerati personal computer e fu allora che nacque il fenomeno dell'home computing.Quarant'anni fa un IBM 5150 con 10 MB di disco fisso e una copia di Word sarebbe costato qualcosa come l'equivalente odierno di circa 14.000 euro. Un importo folle tanto che la maggior parte degli appassionati sceglieva ad esempio un sistema come il Commodore 64 dal costo di circa 1.500 euro calcolando l'andamento dell'inflazione.Fu proprio nel 1982 che Intel lanciò sul mercato il suo processore 80286 che introdusse il concetto di memoria protetta e favorì la diffusione dei sistemi Unix-like anche sui PC IBM grazie al supporto multi-threading.I prezzi di computer e stampanti sono crollati nel corso degli anni '80 e '90 e lo storage per PC sempre più economico e prestazionale.",

Si tratta dei sistemi che rispondono a certi requisiti in termini di prestazioni, reattività, durata della batteria, ricarica rapida e supporto dei più recenti standard in termini di connettività.L''etichetta' Intel Evo esplicita agli acquirenti che si trovano dinanzi a un prodotto di classe Premium.L'idea alla base di Intel Evo è quella di fornire portatili per un utilizzo 'senza compromessi'. Di solito, infatti, quando si sceglie un notebook compatto e ultrasottile, è necessario sacrificare un po’ di prestazioni.I prodotti che si fregiano della certificazione Intel Evo, invece, soddisfano alcuni requisiti minimi:- Assicurano prestazioni di primo livello pur essendo sottili e leggeri- Si risvegliano dallo stato di stand by in meno di un secondo- Supportano la tecnologia WiFi 6 basata su chip Intel per collegarsi alla rete wireless ad alta velocità- Con la ricarica rapida della batteria si hanno almeno 4 ore di autonomia a fronte di 30 minuti di connessione alla rete elettrica- Garanzia di un'autonomia della batteria pari ad almeno 9 ore sui sistemi dotati di pannello Full HD- Facile connessione con un unico cavo USB-C e supporto per la tecnologia Thunderbolt 4.",

If this happens to you, then you know how frustrating it can be.\n    \nThis is apparently the case with the new HEIF file format. Newer iPhones and iPads currently take pictures in HEIF (High-Efficiency Image Format) and save images with an HEIC extension. This format, with all its advantages, isn’t native to Windows, but you can quite easily convert HEIC files to JPG using Windows’ standard tools, like Photos and Paint (as well as myriad third-party apps).\n    \nWith its ability to occupy very little storage space, it seems like an extension for the long run.
