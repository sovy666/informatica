Whether it be Firefox, Discord, games, or my entire system, things are just randomly crashing. I have looked through my system logs but have not had any luck finding anything. I do find the core dumps of programs that crashed, but with no hint to what caused it.

I do however know that it wasn't an issue until at most 6 months ago.\n When opening the lid of my laptop, the wireless connection is disabled and I have to manually enable it again. journalctl -f shows\n kernel: wlo1: deauthenticating from [MAC address] by local choice (Reason: 3=DEAUTH_LEAVING)\n right before Lid opened. When the lid is closed, the connection remains on as usual.\n The strangest thing is that this doesn't always happen. Upon reboots, it's possible that during that session this issue does not occur. However, if it does occur, it always occurs when opening the lid during that session.\n My laptop has an Intel 7265 wireless controller using the iwlwifi firmware. I use NetworkManager, and if it matters, its plasma-nm frontend for KDE Plasma.

          "description": "I've been using paru and it seems like there's no reason to use pacman. Every time I want to install packages, search, view package files, update, etc. I always use paru because (as far as I can tell) it's basically just pacman but better, since it has AUR packages and I just need to type paru pckgname instead of sudo pacman -Syu pckgname\n Is there any reason to even use pacman if paru exists? Is there anything I'm unknowingly missing out on?\n EDIT: It seems I've created some confusion. I'm obviously not talking about deleting pacman, and I know paru is just a wrapper for it. I'm just talking about \"replacing\" it as in when I want to install or manage packages in the terminal, using the paru command instead of pacman.\n    submitted by    /u/_cool_dog  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been having the worst case of microphone noise. My recorded audio would include a consistent high-pitched static sound that I find best described as \"whine\" (kinda like coil whine). I suspect it's got something to do with my particular motherboard but I have no idea. Plugging in different mics in different places did nothing to help the issue and I would hear it the same with no mic plugged in.\n The solution is to use a package called noise-suppression-for-voice. It uses the same neural net technology as rnnoise which is used by OBS studio. My best results have been achieved by using this along with the echo cancel module. After installing the above package, you want to add the following lines to your default.pa config file (mine is in .config/pulse/default.pa):\n # Create echo cancel source # module-echo-cancel will automatically cancel from the current default source load-module module-echo-cancel source_name=echo_cancel_source # Create denoised mic device load-module module-null-sink sink_name=denoised_mic_sink rate=48000 sink_properties='device.description=\"Denoised Mic\"' load-module module-ladspa-sink sink_name=mic_sink sink_master=denoised_mic_sink label=noise_suppressor_stereo plugin=/usr/lib/ladspa/librnnoise_ladspa.so control=50 sink_properties='device.description=\"Noise Suppressor\"' load-module module-loopback source=echo_cancel_source sink=mic_sink channels=2 source_dont_move=true sink_dont_move=true latency_msec=1 # Set as default source set-default-source denoised_mic_sink.monitor \n    submitted by    /u/sk8r_dude  \n [link]   [comments]",

I tried fixing it by updating archlinux-keyring, but that doesn't work. Is there an easy fix for this? I searched half of the internet to find a solution, and nothing worked.\n Secondly, sometimes it doesn't have the problem with the pgp signature but rather not enough disk space. I mounted the root partition to /mnt and the EFI partition to /mnt/EFI. The root partition is 455 gib in size. My theory is, that it tries to download the packages to my install stick, which is only 16gib.

Touchscreen support is now built in to the Linux kernel, so theoretically, any Linux distribution should be able to run with a touchscreen. That said, not every distribution will be easy to use on a touchscreen, and this comes down to the desktop environment each one works best with. You may have to choose the best Linux distros for a touchscreen that use the optimal desktop out of the box.\n    \nFor example, using a tiling window manager like Awesome or i3 isn’t going to do you much good on a touchscreen without some heavy tweaking. Choose the right desktop environment, and you’ll have a much better time using Linux on this type of hardware.\n   \n\nContent\n\n1. GNOME\n2. KDE Plasma\n3. Cinnamon\n4. Deepin DE\n5.
