(sudo ln -s /usr/bin/sha512sum /usr/bin/sha512)\n Although I'm curious, should we suggest the upstream to change this behavior (how?), or should we suggest Arch developers to add a patch to the dkms package (changing sha512 to sha512sum)?\n    submitted by    /u/yechs  \n [link]   [comments]",

To avoid the undesirable initial delay, I spam click/release tiltwheel left/right. On my Logitech G9, the initial delay is much smaller which I prefer (there's no need to spam click as a workaround).\n Is there any way to decrease the delay for the G502? I use the tiltwheel left/right for volume control where I press and hold the tiltwheel then release. The delay gives the experience of lag. On my keyboard, I typically use low repeat_delay and repeat_rate (configured Sway on Wayland), but I do not see these settings available for the mouse). I also checked the wiki and any indication that this is possible with libinput.\n    submitted by    /u/seeminglyugly  \n [link]   [comments]",

Also the ui seems very buggy, like sometimes I increase the volume and the indicator on kde doesnt move and stuff like that.

          "description": "Windows 10 e 11 integrano la stampante virtuale Microsoft Print to PDF che permette di creare documenti PDF senza installare nient'altro. Come nel caso delle precedenti versioni del sistema operativo Microsoft, tuttavia, Windows 10 e 11 non includono un'opzione per proteggere PDF con password.Eppure fare in modo che un documento PDF sia leggibile soltanto dalla persona in possesso della password corretta si rivela spesso molto utile.Buona parte delle soluzioni software che permettono di proteggere i documenti PDF sono a pagamento e questo tipo di funzione di solito fa parte di costose applicazioni.La buona notizia è che esiste un programma open source in grado di crittografare i documenti PDF usando algoritmi come AES-256 supportato ad esempio Adobe Acrobat 8 e successivi.Il software si chiama PDFEncrypt, utilizza la libreria open source iTextPDF e il suo codice sorgente è disponibile su GitHub.Scaricabile da questa pagina (consigliamo l'uso della versione portabile che non necessita di installazione), PDFEncrypt consente di proteggere PDF senza dover acquistare alcun costoso software.Per usare il programma basta estrarre il contenuto del file Zip in una cartella di propria scelta quindi cliccare due volte sull'eseguibile PDFEncrypt.exe.Il funzionamento è semplicissimo: basta indicare il file PDF da proteggere con password nel campo Choose a file to encrypt, il nome del file che si desidera ottenere e dove si vuole memorizzarlo nel campo Choose a destination for the encrypted file.Nel campo Specify a password si può specificare la password richiesta per l'apertura del file (dovrebbe essere scelta in maniera tale che sia sufficientemente lunga e complessa): con un clic su Generate PDFEncrypt si occupa della generazione di una password adeguata.\n\nPDFEncrypt non nasconde i caratteri inseriti nel campo della password con i classici asterischi o pallini.",

          "description": "Come avevamo anticipato in passato, il legislatore europeo era già al lavoro per giungere alla stesura di una normativa con il preciso intento di regolamentare l'utilizzo delle criptovalute.Nella serata di ieri è arrivata la notizia dell'approvazione di MiCA (Markets in Crypto-assets), un accordo tra Consiglio e Parlamento europeo che getta le basi per l'introduzione di una serie di disposizioni sulla supervisione del mercato delle criptovalute e dei crypto-asset in generale. Il provvedimento prende in considerazione anche l'impatto ambientale che i meccanismi di convalida delle transazioni hanno e chiede garanzie nel merito ai fornitori di servizi di criptovalute, chiamati CASP ovvero Crypto Asset Services Provider.MiCA si interessa delle criptovalute che non sono regolamentate dalla legislazione esistente sui servizi finanziari con l'Autorità europea degli strumenti finanziari e dei mercati (ESMA) che avrà il compito di fornire orientamenti al riguardo.Per contrastare i rischi di riciclaggio di denaro ESMA viene chiamata ad istituire un registro pubblico per i CASP non conformi che forniscono servizi nell'Unione europea senza autorizzazione.Il testo concordato include anche misure contro la manipolazione del mercato e il sostegno delle attività criminali.Secondo le Istituzioni europee, il nuovo quadro giuridico sosterrà inoltre l'integrità del mercato e la stabilità finanziaria regolando le offerte pubbliche di criptovalute.La regolamentazione al varo riguarda anche i Non-Fungible Token (NFT) con la differenza che quelli offerti al pubblico a prezzo fisso, come biglietti per il cinema, oggetti da collezione digitali di marchi di abbigliamento o articoli di gioco in formato digitale saranno esentati dall'ambito del MiCA.",

          "description": "A settembre 1997 due accademici dell'Università di Stanford fondarono Google: si tratta di Larry Page e Sergey Brin, entrambi classe 1973. Page è figlio di cittadini statunitensi: il padre uno dei pionieri dell'informatica d'Oltreoceano e la madre accademica anche lei con un master in informatica in tasca. Brin, invece, è nato a Mosca ed è arrivato negli Stati Uniti all'età di 6 anni; il padre era docente universitario.Quest'anno Google compie 25 anni, un anniversario importante che sarà celebrato per tutto il mese di settembre prossimo. Fu infatti a settembre 1997 che Page e Brin presentarono il motore di ricerca universalmente più conosciuto e utilizzato.Il progetto di un algoritmo di ricerca era stato dapprima presentato in ambito universitario con il nome di BackRub. Era il 1996. Successivamente l'idea dei due divenne un progetto commerciale a pieno titolo.Il nome Google fu fatto derivare dal termine Googol, coniato dal matematico Edward Kasner nel 1938 per fare riferimento al numero rappresentato da un 1 seguito da 100 zeri.",

          "description": "I ricercatori di Black Lotus Labs-Lumen Technologies hanno scoperto l'esistenza di un malware sofisticato e complesso che da circa 2 anni prendeva di mira i router e i dispositivi ad esso collegati.Battezzato ZuoRAT la minaccia sembra apparsa in rete almeno nell'ultimo trimestre 2020 e continua a fare danni ancora oggi nascondendo la sua presenza agli occhi delle vittime.La scoperta è davvero significativa perché riguarda un malware che integra personalizzazioni per l'architettura MIPS, una piattaforma RISC utilizzata in un ampio ventaglio di router. Black Lotus cita alcuni modelli di router a marchio Cisco, Netgear, Asus e DrayTek.ZuoRAT, una volta infettato il router, è in grado di stabilire l'elenco dei dispositivi connessi raccogliendo contemporaneamente le richieste di risoluzione DNS e i pacchetti dati inviati e ricevuti.Alle spiccate abilità tecniche, ZuoRAT abbina funzionalità che gli permettono di rimanere nascosto e usare un 'basso profilo' per scavalcare eventuali tentativi di rilevamento.L'utilizzo di tecniche DNS e HTTP hijacking che hanno come obiettivo quello di modificare il traffico dati servendo ai dispositivi collegati contenuti che non sono quelli legittimi, è evidente spia dell'approccio avanzato che ZuoRAT utilizza.Tanto che i ricercatori ipotizzano la realizzazione del malware a seguito di un ingente investimento da parte di qualche governo.Black Lotus ha aggiunto che l'infrastruttura command and control usata da ZuoRAT appare volutamente complessa con il preciso intento di celare ciò che sta accadendo.",

          "description": "Over the many years of covering Coreboot (going back to when it was called LinuxBIOS!) on Phoronix the selection of supported motherboards has been rather unfortunate especially over the last decade. If wanting to run Coreboot on a system today it basically means running a Google Chromebook, using an outdated server motherboard or old Lenovo ThinkPad that has seen a Coreboot port, or out of reach to most individuals are various server motherboards that are reference platforms or board designs from hyperscalers. But over the past several months the folks at the 3mdeb consulting firm have carried out a terrific feat: porting their \"Dasharo\" downstream of Coreboot to a modern and readily available Intel desktop motherboard. I've been trying this out and it has worked out surprisingly well. Here are my experiences and benchmarks of Coreboot/Dasharo on this Intel Alder Lake motherboard.",

Il problema sorge quando dovremo sbarazzarci del secondo sistema, se non dovesse piacerci, o risultare non compatibile con il nostro computer e le nostre esigenze. Togliere il boot manager e le partizioni aggiuntive, se qualcosa dovesse andare storto durante queste operazioni, potrebbe comportare dei problemi al sistema operativo presente inizialmente da non poter più avviarlo.
