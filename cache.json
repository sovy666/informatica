After rebooting, Gnome Shell felt sluggish, and trying to launch a Vulkan game failed. nvidia-smi failed with the message:\n Failed to initialize NVML: Driver/library version mismatch \n Checking the system log I found these messages from the kernel:\n NVRM: API mismatch: the client has the version 510.68.02, but NVRM: this kernel module has the version 510.60.02. Please NVRM: make sure that this kernel module and all NVIDIA driver NVRM: components have the same version. \n Solution: updating the initramfs:\n # mkinitcpio -P \n After that and a reboot, all is back to normal.\n I checked pacman's log and it didn't do any post-upgrade hook to update the initramfs. I had thought this was automatic, but now I think it's just because I probably hadn't ever done an NVIDIA driver update without a kernel upgrade at the same time -- and the latter does trigger that hook.\n Blame's on me for not reading the wiki carefully:\n  \nIf added to the initramfs, do not forget to run mkinitcpio every time there is a nvidia driver update\n  \nI've now added the extra pacman hook as suggested.\n    submitted by    /u/meithan  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm a CS student who will use arch since I have an Asus laptop that doesn't play nicely with other distros. I'm not an overly security-conscious person but I'm wondering how my arch installation would compare to more common OS like Windows or Mac. I'm using a non privledged user with sudo and have apparmor and firejail enabled, but only with the default profiles. I'm not quite knowledgeable enough to create my own profiles. I also use ufw with the basic ruleset described in the arch wiki. I did some other steps on the arch wiki security page but I didn't want to go too far down the rabbit hole and do anything I don't understand. I've also heard mixed opinions on both apparmor and firejail. Alongside common sense and an adblocker, is this enough basic security? I realize this is largely opinion-based but it's not like I have extremely valuable information on my laptop.\n    submitted by    /u/remdit4me  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Si torna a parlare di attacchi DNS spoofing e DNS poisoning, entrambi noti per avere come obiettivo quello di reindirizzare la vittima verso server Web che non sono quelli legittimi. Gli attacchi hanno luogo modificando la risposta che viene inviata a una richiesta di risoluzione di un nome a dominio oppure alterando il contenuto della cache DNS.Era il 2008 quando il ricercatore Dan Kaminsky parlò di DNS poisoning e delle modalità con cui si poteva forzare un server DNS ad offrire risposte arbitrarie.Da quel momento iniziò un impegno coordinato per risolvere alla base il problema.L'informatica è però fatta di corsi e ricorsi: come già accaduto di recente, quando si parlò del possibile ritorno degli attacchi DNS poisoning, è adesso venuto a galla l'utilizzo di un'implementazione non sicura …",

Storicamente è conosciuto come un browser lento, non aderente agli standard per il Web e privo delle funzioni più evolute che contraddistinguono i prodotti più moderni.Eppure, strano ma vero, alcuni prodotti continuano ancora oggi ad appoggiarsi a Internet Explorer e a basare il loro funzionamento sugli ActiveX, tecnologia presentata nel 1996 da Microsoft stessa e pensata per ampliare le potenzialità e le funzioni delle applicazioni Web.",

In un altro articolo abbiamo visto quando usare un client email e quando preferire una webmail.Se si utilizza un client email come Outlook, Thunderbird, MailBird e così via, per ciascun account di posta che si configura va impostato l'indirizzo del server SMTP.Il protocollo SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) è uno standard che risale ai primi anni '80 ed è utilizzato per disporre l'invio dei messaggi di posta elettronica. È infatti utilizzato per impostare il server di posta in uscita ed è uno dei parametri che vanno verificati per primi quando le email non partono.SMTP può a sua volta basarsi su meccanismi di cifratura dei dati tanto che oggi è altamente sconsigliato usare server di posta che non supportano il protocollo TLS (Transport Layer Security).I protocolli che accettano email in arrivo si chiamano POP e IMAP: abbiamo visto le differenze tra POP3 e IMAP nella ricezione della posta.\nCos'è SMTP relay\n Con il termine SMTP relay si fa riferimento alla procedura che permette di trasferire un'email dal mittente al destinatario sulla rete Internet.Quando si invia un'email il server SMTP del provider cui ci si appoggia o quello della propria azienda si collega con il server indicato nel record MX (Mail eXchanger) del dominio del destinatario.",

Il dispositivo dell'utente è a sua volta collegato con una o più carte di debito o di credito attraverso un portafoglio virtuale.Con il sistema attuale Apple non permette a terzi di elaborare pagamenti attraverso il sistema Pay dicendo che diversamente verrebbero meno la sicurezza e la privacy degli utenti.Al termine dell'indagine preliminare, la Commissione spiega di aver contestato ad Apple la sua decisione di impedire agli sviluppatori di app di accedere all'hardware e al software necessari (utilizzo del chip NFC integrato) a vantaggio della sua soluzione per la gestione dei pagamenti, Apple Pay appunto.'Abbiamo rilevato in via preliminare che Apple potrebbe aver limitato la concorrenza a vantaggio della sua soluzione Apple Pay.",

I risultati ai quali pervengono AMD e NVidia sono però spesso diversi a causa delle particolarità che contraddistinguono le due tecnologie: ne abbiamo parlato nell'articolo in cui spieghiamo come scegliere monitor per PC.La certificazione AdaptiveSync di VESA offre una 'copertura' completa prendendo in considerazione sia le valutazioni di AMD che di NVidia sia una serie di aspetti addizionali.\n\nLa certificazione VESA è 'aperta' offrendo i risultati di 50 differenti test ai quali sono sottoposti i monitori AdaptiveSync: i vari giudizi includono prove tecniche e visive come flickering, frame drop, jitter, tempi di risposta dei pixel (grey to grey o GaG), ghosting, reverse ghosting e altro ancora.Per essere certificati AdaptiveSync i monitor devono supportare una frequenza di refresh minima pari ad almeno 60 Hz spingendosi fino a 144 Hz.Nel caso della certificazione MediaSync bastano un minimo di 48 Hz e un massimo di almeno 60 Hz: questa 'forbice' è ideale per gestire nella maniera più adeguata la resa di qualunque genere di contenuto multimediale.Anche nel caso di MediaSync lo sfarfallio deve essere assente, sono previsti gli stessi requisiti per evitare il ghosting di AdaptiveSync mentre il jitter deve essere pari a ±0,5 ms per una corretta riproduzione su PC di contenuti multimediali che sono tipicamente registrati a 23,976 Hz (valore che VESA stessa indica come uno 'standard' di fatto per gli studios di Hollywood)..",
